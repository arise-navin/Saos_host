/**
 * ITSM PHASE 3 — the catalogue adapter.
 *
 * The CMDB catalogue (`health/catalogue/cmdb.json`) and the ITSM catalogue
 * (`health/rules/itsm/catalogue.json`) do not share a schema. CMDB entries
 * carry derived, engine-ready fields — `base: 'CRITICAL'`, `lane: 2`, `kind`,
 * `track`, `systemicKind` — and `cmdb-quality.js` reads them directly. ITSM
 * entries are the workbook verbatim: `base_severity: 'Critical'`,
 * `remediation_lane: 'Lane 1 where unambiguous, Lane 3 otherwise'`, no
 * `kind`, no `track`.
 *
 * This adapter is the ONE place the two vocabularies meet. It exists so that
 * neither catalogue has to change shape to be read by the other's code, and
 * so that every mapping is a named, tested table rather than a `.toUpperCase()`
 * somewhere. The CMDB path (`catalogueRule`, `addCatalogued`, `effectiveBand`)
 * is untouched.

/**
 * THE SEVERITY MAPPING.
 *
 * Workbook word → engine band. Four of five are the same word upper-cased; the
 * fifth is not: the workbook (and the Schema tab of every SAOS tracker) says
 * **Moderate**, and the engine key is **MEDIUM** — `health/rules.js` keeps the
 * key so stored runs keep their meaning and labels it "Moderate" for display.
 * The weights agree on both sides (100 / 40 / 15 / 5 / 1) and are NOT
 * re-declared here: severity weight is a scoring decision, and scoring is not
 * this phase's.
 *
 * Both directions are explicit and total over their vocabularies. An input
 * outside them throws — a mis-cased "critical" from a hand-edited catalogue
 * must not become a Low finding by falling through a default.
