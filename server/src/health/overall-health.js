/**
 * OVERALL HEALTH — the Full System Scan's one number, and what sits beside it.
 *
 * PURE. Module summaries in; the overall scope out. No socket, no database.
 *
 * ═══ THE DEFINITION (locked 21 Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 *   Overall Health is the weighted mean share of attainable health across the
 *   SCORED areas, each scored area counting once.
 *
 *     overall = Σ w_i × S_i ÷ Σ w_i     over areas with a score
 *
 * It sits ABOVE the module scoring layer and consumes nothing below a
 * module's own summary: CMDB Quality, the ITOM capability checks and ITSM
 * Quality each normalise their own unit (a CI, a check, a work record) so that
 * the size of an area never decides the estate's number. It is NOT a finding
 * count, a record percentage, a rule pass rate, a risk score or a coverage
 * score, and Platform — which has no score by design — is not imputed.
 *
 * ═══ THREE THINGS THE ARCHITECTURE KEEPS APART, KEPT APART ═══
 *
 *   HEALTH      the number, and the band it sits in (the existing vocabulary).
 *   ASSESSMENT  whether the number can be quoted. Any scored area whose number
 *               is withheld or gated makes the overall "Assessment incomplete",
 *               which REPLACES the health word — exactly as it does on an area
 *               card and as the CMDB gate variant publishes a null value.
 *   COVERAGE    how much of the applicable instance was assessed. Never in the
 *               arithmetic: coverage = assessed ÷ (assessed + gaps the instance
 *               could close), with inapplicable populations, uninstalled
 *               products and product gaps outside both sides.
 *
 * Systemic findings are never counted here a second time: CMDB gate blockers
 * are the assessment state, posture is a count beside the score, and findings
 * escalated to Systemic are already inside the CMDB number.
 *
 * ═══ WEIGHTS ═══
 *
 * Equal weights over the scored areas are the declared v1 default — no
 * evidence in this repository prefers one area, and the choice moves the
 * number by less than the band shown beside it. A missing area is dropped and
 * the rest renormalised: missing is never 0 and never 100. The effective
 * weights are stored with every result and hashed into the scoring key, so a
 * later change starts a new trend series rather than repainting history.
