/**
 * CMDB HISTORY — the snapshots every trend rule compares against.
 *
 * PURE: it takes stored runs (manifest plus, optionally, each run's findings) and
 * returns the history a scan hands to the rules. `store.cmdbMeasureHistory`
 * reads the database and calls this; tests call it directly — which is the
 * point, because the version it replaces was untested and silently dropped most
 * of what the trend rules needed.
 *
 * ═══ THE BUG THIS REPLACED (Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * The old reader returned exactly two trend measures, `duplicate_sets` and
 * `relationship_counts`. CMDB-096 reads `class_growth` and CMDB-125/128/129 read
 * `scale_snapshot`, and neither was ever returned — so in production those rules
 * could NEVER leave their "needs N snapshots" abstention. Their fixture tests
 * passed because fixtures inject history directly, skipping the reader. Every
 * trend measure is now declared once, in `TREND_MEASURE_KEYS`, and the test
 * suite exercises this function rather than a hand-built history.
 *
 * ═══ WHICH RUNS ARE SNAPSHOTS OF THE CMDB ═══
 *
 * A trend compares like with like, and the run table is full of things that are
 * not a CMDB snapshot. Measured on dev424910's own history:
 *
 *   an ITSM-only scan       carries zero CMDB findings. Compared naively, every
 *                           CMDB defect would read as RESOLVED.
 *   a verification run      reads nothing and stores no findings at all.
 *   a degraded CMDB read    stores the findings of the tables it could read, so
 *                           everything on the others would read as resolved.
 *   a truncated run         stored only part of what it found.
 *
 * Each is excluded, and the exclusions are returned with their reasons so a
 * trend that has too few snapshots can say why.
 *
 * ═══ COMPARABLE IS NOT THE SAME AS ELIGIBLE ═══
 *
 * An eligible snapshot is a genuine picture of the CMDB. Whether two pictures can
 * be COMPARED is a separate question — the rules decide it with each snapshot's
 * `comparability` key (see `scoringComparability` in rules.js). Measured on the
 * same history: the two most recent CMDB runs read 82.1 then 77.0, and 11,618
 * then 20,954 findings, and both differences were caused entirely by rule
 * changes that week. Nothing in the estate had moved.
 */

/*
 * ═══ COMPARABILITY IS A PROPERTY OF THE MEASURE (decided 17 Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * Whether an earlier reading may be compared with this one depends on WHAT was
 * measured, never on which rule is asking:
 *
 *   raw      a count the platform itself holds — rows per class, edges, creation
 *            dates. No rule, threshold or setting of ours decides it, so a rule
 *            change cannot move it: it is compared across rule versions.
 *   derived  a result our rules, thresholds or per-estate settings produced —
 *            duplicate-set membership, stale-CI lists, bulk-touch groups,
 *            attestation outcomes, findings and scores. A rule change moves it,
 *            so it is compared ONLY with readings under the same comparability key.
 *
 * The first build left the decision to each rule, and two rules reading the SAME
 * measure disagreed: CMDB-134 required the key for duplicate-set membership and
 * CMDB-038 did not. The tag now lives here, `comparableHistory` enforces it, and
 * EstateRules passes every assignment of `history` through it — so no rule can
 * see a derived reading from another model, and none can opt out. A measure with
 * no tag never reaches a rule at all, and a test fails if a rule reads one. The
 * same shape as MODIFIER_FAMILY: the property belongs to the thing, not the caller.
 *
 * WHEN UNSURE, A MEASURE IS DERIVED. A wrong `derived` costs a baseline; a wrong
 * `raw` reports a rule change as a change in the estate.
