/**
 * GROUP 7 — FRESHNESS AND SOURCE COVERAGE (D7). CMDB-070 to CMDB-079.
 *
 * Not "is the record right" but "is anything still saying so". A CMDB decays
 * silently: nothing in it changes colour when the thing it describes is gone, so
 * the only question that matters here is which process last confirmed each
 * record, and how long ago.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT THIS INSTANCE KEEPS (verified on dev424910, Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 *   discovery_schedule          THE TABLE DOES NOT EXIST — Discovery is not
 *                               installed. That is not a failure to read; it is
 *                               the estate's posture, and CMDB-070 says so
 *                               rather than gating on a product nobody owns.
 *   discovery_device_history    0 rows. discovery_status 0 rows.
 *   discovery_range_item        3 rows, all from 2010: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12
 *                               and 192.168.0.0/16 — the whole private space,
 *                               under one discovery_range, with no schedule.
 *   cmdb_ci.last_discovered     10 of 2,784 CIs, last seen in 2007.
 *   cmdb_ci.discovery_source    50 CIs, every one "Other Automated", and every
 *                               one of those 50 has an EMPTY first_discovered.
 *                               That is CMDB-073, and it is the only rule in
 *                               this group the estate can answer in full.
 *   sys_object_source           0 rows. cmdb_datasource_last_update 0 rows.
 *                               cmdb_metadata does not exist. So there is NO
 *                               per-CI source attribution and no per-ATTRIBUTE
 *                               last-seen: CMDB-074 and CMDB-076 cannot run, and
 *                               say why instead of reporting a clean 100.
 *   sys_import_set / _row       0 rows, so a CI created by an import cannot be
 *                               told from one typed by hand — which makes
 *                               CMDB-078 an UPPER BOUND and CMDB-079 unmeasurable.
 *
 *   THE BULK TOUCH. 2,659 of 2,784 CIs carry the same sys_updated_on — one
 *   `system` write on 2026-04-30 — and only 124 CIs were updated before 2026.
 *   Record-level freshness therefore reads as almost perfect while nothing has
 *   confirmed a single attribute. That is precisely the illusion CMDB-076 exists
 *   to break, so the numbers are reported in its gap note even though the rule
 *   itself cannot run.
 *
 * ═══ INTENT (decision 5 of Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * The staleness rules here are QUALITY rules and never charge a retired, stolen
 * or absent CI: a decommissioned server nobody rediscovers is doing exactly what
 * it should. The contradiction rules (CMDB-073, CMDB-076) run over the FULL
 * estate, because a dead CI still claiming a live source is the finding.
 *
 * A dead CI that is still being ACTIVELY DISCOVERED is a contradiction too, and
 * it is measured here — but it is not charged here. CMDB-087 (D8, Group 8) is
 * the rule that owns it, so this group records the population in
 * `measures.retired_still_discovered` and leaves the charge to the dimension
 * that owns lifecycle. Counting it twice would be worse than counting it late.
 *
 * PURE — no network, no database.
