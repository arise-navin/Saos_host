/**
 * INCREMENTAL SCANNING — skip a module whose inputs have not changed.
 *
 * ═══ WHY NOT "FETCH ONLY sys_updated_on > last scan" ═══
 *
 * The rules judge whole tables: duplicates, class sizes, relationship walks,
 * the average over every CI. No local copy of the records is kept (a decision
 * of 15 Sep 2026), so a read of only the changed rows would have nothing to
 * compare them against and would report a fraction of the estate as all of it.
 *
 * So the unit of reuse is the MODULE. Before reading, every table a module's
 * last result was computed from is asked one question through the Aggregate
 * API — its row count and its newest `sys_updated_on`:
 *
 *   an insert or an update  moves the newest timestamp
 *   a delete                moves the count
 *   neither moved           nothing in that slice changed
 *
 * A module whose every input is unchanged keeps its last result, marked as
 * verified now; any change re-reads that module in full.
 *
 * ═══ THE STAMP IS TAKEN BEFORE THE READ, AND BELONGS TO THE RESULT ═══
 *
 * A table's stamp is taken immediately before its rows are read (in the same
 * call that counts them). Anything that changes after the stamp moves it, so
 * it is caught next time even if the read happened to include it — a false
 * "changed" costs a re-read; a false "unchanged" would cost a wrong answer, and
 * this order cannot produce one.
 *
 * Stamps are compared against the run that PRODUCED the module's current result,
 * never against "the last time anything read this table". An ITSM-only scan
 * re-reads `cmdb_ci` too; if that moved a shared per-table timestamp, the next
 * CMDB check would compare against it and reuse a CMDB result computed from
 * older rows.
 *
 * ═══ DELETIONS ═══
 *
 * Tables the instance keeps a deletion log for (audited dictionary collections,
 * and `glide.ui.audit_deleted_tables`) are checked in `sys_audit_delete` as
 * well, so a change can say how many records were deleted. Every other table —
 * `cmdb_ci` among them on a default instance — is covered by the count, which
 * is why the count is compared for every table regardless.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT CANNOT BE SEEN, AND THE BACKSTOPS ═══
 *
 *   - Time alone changes some answers (a CI crosses 90 days untouched, a task
 *     ages past its threshold) with no row changing. A result older than
 *     `maxReuseHours` is re-read whatever the stamps say.
 *   - A change of rules, catalogue, settings or accepted risks changes answers
 *     over unchanged rows: each module's ENGINE KEY must match.
 *   - A different connected account sees different rows: it must match.
 *   - A field added to a table's read: the table's spec hash must match.
