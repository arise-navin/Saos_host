/**
 * The deterministic rule pack — Health Assist's findings engine.
 *
 * Ported from SAOS `app/agents/domain_analysis.py`, and kept PURE on purpose:
 * this module takes an already-extracted estate and returns findings. It opens
 * no socket, reads no database and calls no model. That is what makes it
 * testable offline against fixtures, and it is the same reason `agent/lint/` is
 * shaped this way — a finding produced by a rule can be argued with; one
 * produced by a model cannot.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST is coverage gating. A rule that fires on the
 * ABSENCE of something (no relationships, no service offering) is only sound if
 * the extraction that found nothing was complete. Partial extraction plus an
 * absence rule is how "we could not read the table" becomes "your CMDB is
 * broken". So `rows()` refuses to serve a table whose coverage is not good
 * enough and records WHY in `skipped[]`, and the absence rules additionally
 * demand `complete`. This is the same distinction the ACL module draws with
 * `visibility: full | empty | restricted` — an empty result is never rendered
 * as an answer.
 */

/*
 * 3.0.0 (Sep 2026): the full CMDB catalogue (Groups 1–14), consequence scoping,
 * and per-dimension-type blends. The composite no longer means what 2.0.0's did,
 * so scores from before and after must not be trended against each other.
 *
 * BUMP THIS WHEN A RULE'S DETECTION LOGIC CHANGES. `scoringComparability` hashes
 * the catalogue, the implemented rule set and the blends, but it cannot see a
 * change inside a rule's code — this version is how that change is declared.
 *
 * 3.0.1 (Sep 2026): the first bump under that discipline, from the Group 14
 * live run. A CMDB-only scan now STORES the Group 13 findings it used to drop
 * (findings route by rule prefix, not domain), and CMDB-131 counts a finding as
 * created only when its rule produced findings on the earlier run. No run keyed
 * under 3.0.0 had been persisted, so nothing comparable is set aside by it.
 *
 * 3.0.2 (17 Sep 2026, CMDB checkpoint): CMDB-124's endpoint tier expects no
 * edges by default; CMDB-038 can no longer trend duplicate sets measured under
 * another model (comparability is now a property of the measure); CMDB-128 says
 * a flat estate is flat. Again no run keyed under 3.0.1 had been persisted.

   * platform code lists go stale silently), so no rule keys off a state number.
