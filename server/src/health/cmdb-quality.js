/**
 * CMDB QUALITY — the two-layer score the SAOS rule catalogue defines.
 *
 * PURE. Findings, KPI measurements and a scope in; a score out. No socket, no
 * database, no model.
 *
 * ═══ WHY TWO LAYERS ═══
 *
 * The previous CMDB number was a pass rate: the share of CIs no rule objected
 * to. One Low finding failed a whole record, which is how an estate scored
 * 0.3%. It also let a broken GOVERNANCE mechanism — no inclusion rule, a dead
 * health job — sit inside the same arithmetic as a missing serial number.
 *
 *   LAYER 1 — THE TRUST GATE. A finding whose BASE severity is Systemic never
 *   deducts from a record. It decides whether the number can be believed: while
 *   one is live the score is "not trustworthy", with the reasons.
 *
 *   LAYER 2 — DIMENSION SCORES, then the composite.
 *     record_score(r, d) = max(0, 100 − Σ w(effective band))   over record findings in d on r
 *     record_part(d)     = mean record_score over in-scope records
 *     kpi_part(d)        = mean passing % of the percentage rules measured in d
 *     dimension_score(d) = 70% record_part + 30% kpi_part when both exist; whichever exists otherwise
 *     composite          = Σ weight_d × score_d ÷ Σ weight_d over MEASURED dimensions
 *   w: Critical 40 · High 15 · Moderate 5 · Low 1 · escalated-to-Systemic 100.
 *
 * ═══ RULES ARE ROUTED BY KIND (decisions of 16 Sep) ═══
 *
 *   record   — deducts from the records it names.
 *   kpi      — a percentage or ratio. Scored at the level it measures: its
 *              passing % is a dimension sub-score. Never smeared across records.
 *   context  — structural context (e.g. classes with fewer than five records):
 *              shown, never scored.
 *   trend    — shown; gates only if its base is Systemic.
 *
 * And by TRACK. The composite is a DATA-QUALITY score, so findings that are
 * not data quality never move it: governance posture (Group 9), the platform
 * indicator (Group 13), drift and regression (Group 14) and CSDM maturity
 * (Group 11 outside D10) are counted in their own panels. A base-Systemic
 * finding gates whatever its track.
 *
 * ═══ TWO PROVISIONAL STATES, NEVER MERGED ═══
 *
 *   gate-provisional      a base-Systemic finding is live  → "Score not trustworthy"
 *   coverage-provisional  not every dimension is measured  → "Provisional — x of 100 weight measured"
 *
 * ═══ GATE-SYSTEMIC IS NOT ESCALATED-SYSTEMIC ═══
 *
 * A record finding escalated to Systemic by its context zeroes its record
 * (w = 100). It COUNTED, so it is not a blocker: it is listed as "Escalated —
 * Systemic" with the chain that got it there, apart from the gate.
 *
 * ═══ SYSTEMIC IS NOT THE SAME AS GATE (16 Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * A Systemic finding gates only when it invalidates what the composite MEANS.
 * `systemicKind` decides, per rule:
 *   config_absence  gate only (CMDB-001, 002, 044, 045)
 *   measured_kpi    gate on breach AND contribute its sub-score (CMDB-003, 046, 057, 070, 141)
 *   posture         neither gate nor score — shown as Systemic posture (CMDB-038, 056, 091, 104, 112, 131)
 *   derived         shown only (CMDB-116, computed from the composite itself)
 *
 * ═══ A RECORD IS CHARGED FOR ITS OWN CONTEXT, NEVER ITS CLASS'S (16 Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * A per-CI escalator (business-critical support, production, shared
 * infrastructure…) is a property of the CI: at effective Systemic it zeroes
 * THAT record. The class-defect-rate escalator is a property of the CLASS: it
 * raises reporting severity by surfacing one pattern finding, and never changes
 * what a record is charged. So every record finding carries two bands:
 * `severity` (where it is reported) and `deduction_severity` (what it costs).
 *
 * ═══ ONE DEFECT, ONE CHARGE ═══
 *
 * One duplicate pair is caught by several rules at once (serial, address,
 * asymmetric, fuzzy). Findings that describe the same set share a
 * `dedupe_key`, and a record pays only the heaviest of them.

/**
 * ═══ THE BLEND IS PER DIMENSION TYPE, NOT ONE GLOBAL RATIO (Sep 2026) ═══
 *
 * A dimension score blends its mean RECORD score with the mean pass rate of its
 * PERCENTAGE rules. One ratio for all ten dimensions assumed they ask the same
 * shape of question, and they do not.
 *
 * Measured on dev424910 when D10 was completed: its record part was 96.0 and its
 * KPI part 0.0, so the blend alone decided the score — 67.2 at 70/30, 38.4 at
 * 40/60. And the record part was near-inert BY DESIGN: consequence scoping
 * correctly makes a long tail of unreferenced laptops quiet, which leaves a mean
 * of 96 that moves barely at all. Meanwhile the KPI half was saying something
 * stark and true — no incident in the window named a CI, and impact analysis
 * returned nothing 52 times out of 52.
 *
 * So the ratio follows the SHAPE of the question:
 *
 *   record   the defect is a property of a record, and counting records is the
 *            measurement. Completeness, correctness, uniqueness, lifecycle,
 *            ownership. (These currently publish no KPIs at all, so the ratio is
 *            moot for them today — it is declared for when they do.)
 *   mixed    per-record defects AND an estate-level rate both carry real signal.
 *            Relationships, freshness, identification, reconciliation.
 *   estate   the question is about the estate, not about any record. Consumption
 *            is the clear case: "does anybody use this CMDB" cannot be answered
 *            by averaging CIs, and a per-record mean will always flatter it.
 *
 * This is consequence scoping applied one level up: where a defect is
 * near-universal and low-consequence per record, the per-record mean stops being
 * informative, and the dimension's weight belongs with the measure that still is.
