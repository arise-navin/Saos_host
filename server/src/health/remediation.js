/**
 * The remediation catalogue — what a finding means, and what to do about it.
 *
 * Human-authored and keyed by rule, NOT generated. The rules are deterministic,
 * so their remediation can be too: the same rule always means the same thing,
 * and asking a model to re-explain it on every page load would introduce
 * variance into the one part of this module that has none.
 *
 * THE FIELD THAT MATTERS MOST IS `decision`.
 *
 *   'mechanical' — the finding states its own fix. A relationship whose parent
 *                  and child are the same CI is wrong in every estate; there is
 *                  nothing to weigh.
 *   'human'      — the finding states a FACT, and the fix requires a judgement
 *                  the data cannot supply. "This CI has no owner" does not tell
 *                  you who owns it, and a system that picks one is inventing an
 *                  accountable party.
 *
 * Most of these are 'human', and the UI says so rather than offering a Fix
 * button that would quietly guess. That is the same line the Access module
 * draws by refusing to author ACLs at all: the cost of a confident wrong write
 * here lands on somebody's CMDB, not on a test.
 *
 * `effort` is an ESTIMATE and is labelled as one everywhere it surfaces.
 * Nothing here was timed against a stopwatch; the numbers are per-record
 * working estimates for a competent admin, and `basis` says what each assumes
 * so a reader can disagree with it.
