/**
 * Plain-language summaries over findings that already exist.
 *
 * The model is downstream of the rules and can only ever be downstream of them:
 * it receives DERIVED facts — an opaque id, the rule, the domain, the severity,
 * a record count — and returns prose keyed by those ids. It never sees record
 * names, scripts or sys_ids, it cannot add a finding, and an answer naming an
 * id that was not sent is discarded whole.
 *
 * That last check is the important one. Without it a model that invents an id
 * gets its invention rendered beside real findings, where it reads exactly like
 * one. The same reasoning as `explainAclReport`: the structured result is read
 * off the instance, the paragraph is generated, and the two are never blurred.
 *
 * The pass is OPTIONAL and its failure is never the run's failure. A model that
 * is unreachable, slow, or looping leaves `status: "unavailable"` on the
 * manifest and every deterministic finding intact.
