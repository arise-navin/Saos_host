/**
 * Scopes — CMDB, ITOM, ITSM and Platform, and what "score" honestly means for each.
 *
 * PURE. Coverage and findings in, summaries out: no socket, no database, no
 * model. The same function runs at the end of a check and against a stored run,
 * which is what lets an older run be re-read under the new switch without being
 * re-extracted.
 *
 * ═══ WHY THE SCORES ARE NOT ALL THE SAME KIND ═══
 *
 * A single formula applied to every scope would produce four numbers that look
 * comparable and are not.
 *
 *   CMDB  — the SAOS CMDB Quality score, in two layers (see cmdb-quality.js):
 *           a TRUST GATE that says whether the number may be believed at all,
 *           and a COMPOSITE of ten weighted dimensions over the dimensions
 *           actually measured. It is not a pass rate: the first version was the
 *           share of CIs no rule objected to, where one Low finding failed a
 *           whole record — which is how an estate scored 0.3%.
 *   ITSM  — ITSM QUALITY (itsm-quality.js, 21 Sep 2026): the same two-part
 *           shape as CMDB. A record in the open-or-recent incident, change and
 *           problem slice starts at 100 and loses the weight of each distinct
 *           charge on it, floored at 0; that mean is blended 60/40 with the
 *           share of estate-level catalogue rules that pass. It replaced a
 *           record pass rate in which one Moderate finding failed a whole
 *           record — the shape that scored an estate 0.7.
 *   ITOM  — a CHECK score. ITOM's important findings are about ABSENCE — no MID
 *           server, Discovery never ran — and name no records at all. "No MID
 *           server" cannot be a percentage of rows, so ITOM is scored as the
 *           share of applicable capability checks that pass.
 *   Platform — NO score. 42,000 role assignments and fourteen integrations have
 *           no shared denominator; any percentage would be decided by whichever
 *           table happened to be largest, which is a fact about table sizes and
 *           not about health. It says so rather than printing one.
 *
 * ═══ THE RULE EVERY SCORE OBEYS ═══
 *
 * A score only ever describes what was read. A table whose rows were not all
 * read is EXCLUDED from its scope's denominator and named in `basis`; if nothing
 * usable is left, the score is withheld with the specific reason. A check whose
 * table could not be read is `not_applicable`, never a pass — "we could not see
 * the MID server table" must not score as "the MID servers are fine".
 */

/*
 * THE MODULES ARE DEFINED IN modules.js (Health Assist Phase 1). Their domains,
 * tables, score kind, rule prefixes and overrides used to be written out here;
 * they now come from the one registry, and every constant below is derived from
 * it. test/health-modules.test.js holds each derived value (and the SQL filter)
 * equal to a snapshot taken before the move.
