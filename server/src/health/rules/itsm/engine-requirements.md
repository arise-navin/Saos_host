# ITSM rule engines — Phase 2 requirements

What the 139 catalogued ITSM rules need in order to execute, grouped by the
reusable engine that would run them. Derived from
[`architecture-map.json`](./architecture-map.json); the rule lists below are
held to that file by `test/health-itsm-architecture.test.js`.

**Status: analysis only.** Nothing in this document is built. The health engine
still runs the eleven hard-coded ITSM rules in `health/rules.js`, scores ITSM in
`health/scopes.js`, and reads neither the catalogue nor the map.

The principle: **build one engine, configure many rules.** A rule is a row of
parameters (table, fields, predicate, threshold, window) handed to an engine;
it is not a function of its own. Every engine below therefore states its
**input contract** (what a rule row must supply) and its **output contract**
(what it hands to the finding pipeline), so that a rule can be added by editing
data rather than code once the engine exists.

## How the current architecture works — the parts each engine reuses

| Component | Where | What it does today | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Extraction allow-list + slice | `health/tables.js` `TABLES`, `sliceWhere`, `ITSM_WINDOW_DAYS` | Only allow-listed tables are read; ITSM tables read `active OR updated ≤ 90 d`; per-spec field list | every engine that reads rows |
| Keyset walk + coverage | `health/extract.js` `fetchTable`, `extractEstate`; `servicenow/dba-metadata.js` `pageAll` | 500/page keyset paging, `reported_total`, `rows_complete`, `missing_fields`, ≤ 100 000 rows | every engine that reads rows |
| Aggregate primitives | `servicenow/client.js` `table.count`, `table.countBy` (one group-by), `table.changeStamp` (count + max) | Row counts and single-field group-bys over an encoded query | Aggregate, Linkage, Reference Integrity |
| Rule context | `health/rules.js` `EstateRules.rows()` (coverage-gated rows), `add()` (finding + per-field evidence + fingerprint), `addCatalogued()` (catalogue-driven severity), `skipped[]`, `kpis[]`, `measures{}` | The finding pipeline every rule feeds | all engines |
| Severity arithmetic | `health/cmdb-quality.js` `effectiveBand(base, {escalators, deEscalators})`, `catalogueRule()` | base band ± modifiers, clamped Low…Systemic; catalogue lookup (CMDB only) | all engines (needs an ITSM catalogue adapter) |
| Context signals | `health/cmdb-signals.js` `buildSignals`, `modifiersFor`, `materialityFor`, `DQ_INACTIVE_INSTALL_STATUS` | Business-Critical support traversal, production, shared infra, retiring, approved exception; retired-CI statuses | Reference Integrity, Relationship Graph, severity modifiers |
| Relationship graph | `health/rules.js` `synthesize()` (undirected adjacency from `cmdb_rel_ci`, BFS depth 3) | Reachability per finding | Relationship Graph, Temporal Correlation |
| Bounded configuration reads | `health/extract.js` `extractCmdbMeta`, `cmdbMetaSources` | Small targeted reads (class hierarchy, `sys_choice`, `sys_audit` counts, `sys_trigger`) each with its own status, stamped for the change check | Configuration |
| Schema / choices / dictionary | `servicenow/schema.js` `getSchema`, `getTableHierarchy`; `servicenow/dba-schema.js` `listFields`, `getField`, `listChoices`, `getReferences` | Field lists, `mandatory`, choice lists per field, reference targets | Configuration |
| SLA definitions and schedules | `servicenow/sla.js` `listSlas`, `getSla`, `slaMeta` (schedules, `schedule_source`) | Reads `contract_sla` and `cmn_schedule` | Configuration, Linkage (SLA scope), Temporal Correlation (blackouts) |
| Per-record history readers | `servicenow/diagnostics.js` `auditFor`, `journalFor`, `slasFor`, `ciRelationshipsFor` | `sys_audit`, `sys_journal_field`, `task_sla` for ONE record, bounded by `LIMITS` | Audit & Journal (as a bridge for small populations only) |
| Run-to-run measures | `EstateRules.measures` → `manifest.cmdb_quality.measures` → `store.cmdbMeasureHistory()` → `measureHistory` | A rule records a measure; later runs receive earlier values (CMDB-038 trend) | Aggregate (trends) |
| Incremental change check | `health/incremental.js` `planScan`, `engineKeys`, `stampSources` | Per-module reuse when every input table's count + newest update is unchanged | all — every new table an engine reads must be declared as a module input |
| Remediation catalogue | `health/remediation.js` `REMEDIATION`, `fromCatalogue()`; `health/proposal.js` `FIX_FIELD` | Per-rule manual steps, effort, agent prompt; field-fix proposals | Phase 4+; note `fromCatalogue()` reads camelCase CMDB keys, not the snake_case ITSM catalogue |
| Storage | `health/store.js` `completeRun` → `health_findings` (`evidence_json`, `impact_json`, `scoring_json`) | One row per finding; fingerprint = sha256(rule|table|sorted sys_ids) | all — see "Output contract gaps" |

**Execution model today:** `runHealthCheck` → `planScan` (change check) →
`extractEstate` (every table, sequentially, whole slice into memory) →
`EstateRules.analyze` (pure, per-family) → `summariseScopes` (ITSM = share of
slice records with no finding) → `completeRun`. Findings are per-(rule, record);
severity is a literal per rule; ITSM has no catalogue, no thresholds, no
configuration reads, no history, no text analysis, no correlation.

---

## 1. Record Predicate Engine (`record_predicate`)

**Purpose.** Evaluate a per-record predicate over the fields of one task table
(incident, change_request, problem) and emit one finding per offending record,
with an optional ratio over the slice.

**Primary rules (21):** ITSM-005, ITSM-020, ITSM-036, ITSM-037, ITSM-042, ITSM-049, ITSM-052, ITSM-062, ITSM-067, ITSM-068, ITSM-089, ITSM-096, ITSM-097, ITSM-098, ITSM-099, ITSM-100, ITSM-102, ITSM-103, ITSM-111, ITSM-118, ITSM-119

**Supporting (10):** ITSM-009, ITSM-027, ITSM-029, ITSM-038, ITSM-043, ITSM-044, ITSM-051, ITSM-056, ITSM-070, ITSM-108

**Existing support:** FULL 13 · PARTIAL 5 · NONE 3 (the NONE cases are trivial
predicates on UNDEFINED plugin tables: ITSM-052 PIR actions, ITSM-089 template
review dates, ITSM-118 conflict overrides).

**Input contract (per rule).** `table`, `scope` (open / resolved / closed /
approved-or-closed — expressed as an encoded query, never a state number),
`fields[]` to extract, `predicate` (field-state test, trimmed-length test, or
timestamp arithmetic between two fields with a tolerance), `threshold`
parameters (e.g. 20 chars, 60 s, 1 h, per-priority days), `evidence_fields[]`,
`report_ratio` (bool).

**Required ServiceNow data.** Table API over the ITSM slice with the fields
added to the spec: incident `close_notes, closed_at, closed_by, impact,
urgency, business_service, problem_id, rfc, caller_id, resolved_by,
reassignment_count`; change_request `implementation_plan, backout_plan,
test_plan, justification, reason, risk, impact, approval, work_start,
work_end, business_service, close_notes, parent`; problem `cause_notes,
workaround, rfc, known_error, business_service, closed_at, fix_notes`.

**Output contract.** Record findings (`table`, `target_ids: [sys_id]`,
evidence per field) plus, when `report_ratio`, a `kpis[]` entry
`{rule_id, numerator, denominator, pass_pct, basis}`.

**Performance.** Field-state predicates can be pushed server-side as encoded
queries (`implementation_planISEMPTY`), which is the difference between reading
100 000 rows and reading only the offenders. Field-to-field timestamp
arithmetic (ITSM-036, ITSM-111) cannot be expressed in an encoded query and
stays row-level. Large text fields (`close_notes`, the three change plans) are
the volume risk: request them only for rules that need them, or use ISEMPTY
pushdown and never retrieve the body.

**Existing code reused.** `EstateRules.rows()` / `add()` unchanged; the current
`ITSM-INC-P1-AGED` and `ITSM-CHG-NO-CI` are this engine's shape.

**New functionality.** (a) Rule rows as data (predicate DSL: `empty`, `length_lt`,
`interval_lt/gt` between fields, `date_before now±N`); (b) per-rule field
selection so the extraction spec is the union of what active rules need;
(c) encoded-query pushdown for field-state predicates as an alternative to the
whole-slice read; (d) a threshold registry with the workbook defaults.

---

## 2. Aggregate & Distribution Engine (`aggregate`)

**Purpose.** Compute counts, ratios, shares, distributions, dominance and
run-to-run trends over a slice — optionally grouped — and judge them against a
threshold, producing an estate-level finding that carries the metric.

**Primary rules (19):** ITSM-001, ITSM-008, ITSM-016, ITSM-017, ITSM-024, ITSM-030, ITSM-031, ITSM-032, ITSM-033, ITSM-041, ITSM-053, ITSM-059, ITSM-079, ITSM-083, ITSM-094, ITSM-107, ITSM-113, ITSM-121, ITSM-135

**Supporting (51):** ITSM-002, ITSM-003, ITSM-004, ITSM-006, ITSM-007, ITSM-009, ITSM-012, ITSM-013, ITSM-014, ITSM-015, ITSM-020, ITSM-022, ITSM-023, ITSM-025, ITSM-026, ITSM-034, ITSM-035, ITSM-036, ITSM-037, ITSM-039, ITSM-042, ITSM-045, ITSM-057, ITSM-058, ITSM-062, ITSM-073, ITSM-074, ITSM-077, ITSM-080, ITSM-081, ITSM-082, ITSM-085, ITSM-086, ITSM-087, ITSM-089, ITSM-090, ITSM-091, ITSM-092, ITSM-097, ITSM-098, ITSM-103, ITSM-104, ITSM-116, ITSM-123, ITSM-124, ITSM-125, ITSM-129, ITSM-130, ITSM-131, ITSM-132, ITSM-133

This is the most-shared engine: 70 of 139 rules use it as primary or support.

**Input contract.** `table`, `slice` (encoded query), `measure`
(`count` | `ratio(numerator_query, denominator_query)` | `share_by(field)` |
`distribution(field)` | `histogram(expression, buckets)` | `trend(measure, windows)`),
`group_by[]` (0–2 fields), `threshold` (`{op, value, escalate_at?}` — e.g.
8 % escalate 15 %, 70 % in one band), `minimum_volume` (UNDEFINED for most
rules — must be supplied), `window`.

**Required ServiceNow data.** Aggregate API: `sysparm_count`,
`sysparm_group_by` (multi-field), `sysparm_avg_fields` / `sysparm_sum_fields`
for effort (ITSM-057, ITSM-058); Table API only when a distribution needs a
derived expression the API cannot group on (resolution-to-target intervals).
Tables: incident, change_request, problem, task_sla, sys_choice (list to
compare against), sysapproval_approver (candidate, ITSM-107/121).

**Output contract.** One estate-level finding per breached threshold with
`target_ids: []` (`estate_wide: true`) and a `metric` block:
`{measure, observed, threshold, breached, groups: [{key, observed, n}], window, basis}`;
always a `kpis[]` entry whether or not the threshold is breached; a
`measures[]` snapshot for trended rules. **Drill-down** (the workbook's
"Evidence to Show" is almost always a breakdown by group/category/code) is the
grouped metric, not per-record evidence rows.

**Performance.** With Aggregate API pushdown every primary rule here is O(groups),
independent of table size — this engine is how the ITSM check stops scaling
with the incident table. Without pushdown (in-memory over the extracted slice)
it inherits the 100 000-row cap and the score is withheld on any real estate.
Trends across windows are N counts, not N reads.

**Existing code reused.** `table.count`, `table.countBy` (one group-by),
`ctx.kpis` shape, `ctx.measures` + `measureHistory` for trends, the
`estate_wide` finding path in `add()` and its max-impact priority handling.

**New functionality.** (a) Multi-field group-by and avg/sum wrappers in
`client.js`; (b) the measure/threshold evaluator; (c) the `metric` block on a
finding and its storage (`scoring_json` or a new column); (d) two-tier
thresholds (`escalate_at`); (e) an "expected distribution" evaluator for
ITSM-024 and ITSM-035 (UNDEFINED statistical test — a decision, not code);
(f) minimum-volume guards (ITSM-124's FPG).

---

## 3. Configuration Inspection Engine (`configuration`)

**Purpose.** Read platform configuration objects, compare them with actual
usage, and report configuration findings ("configured but unused", "used but
not configured", "absent").

**Primary rules (24):** ITSM-002, ITSM-003, ITSM-004, ITSM-006, ITSM-009, ITSM-010, ITSM-011, ITSM-012, ITSM-013, ITSM-014, ITSM-015, ITSM-029, ITSM-045, ITSM-051, ITSM-080, ITSM-081, ITSM-082, ITSM-085, ITSM-086, ITSM-087, ITSM-090, ITSM-091, ITSM-092, ITSM-093

**Supporting (17):** ITSM-001, ITSM-005, ITSM-007, ITSM-008, ITSM-031, ITSM-034, ITSM-083, ITSM-084, ITSM-089, ITSM-110, ITSM-112, ITSM-117, ITSM-122, ITSM-127, ITSM-131, ITSM-137, ITSM-138

**Existing support:** PARTIAL 9 · NONE 15. The split is by object: what
`schema.js`, `dba-schema.js` and `sla.js` already read (choices, dictionary,
SLA definitions, schedules) is PARTIAL; approval workflows, assignment rules,
notifications, UI/data policies, change models, MIM, CAB, conflict detection
and the change calendar have no reader.

**Input contract.** `object` (a named configuration source with its own read
strategy), `comparison` (`unused_in_window` | `used_but_absent` | `absent_where_volume` |
`mandatory_at_state` | `covers_bands`), the usage `measure` (delegated to the
Aggregate engine), `baseline` where the rule compares with an OOB set
(ITSM-013, ITSM-091 — UNDEFINED, must be supplied as data).

**Required ServiceNow data — by object.**

| Object (rules) | Source | Reader today |
|---|---|---|
| Choice lists incl. `dependent_value` (002, 006, 008, 009, 013, 091) | `sys_choice` | `getSchema` (no `dependent_value`), `listChoices` |
| Dictionary: custom fields, `mandatory` (014, 090) | `sys_dictionary` (+ `sys_update_xml` for creating set) | `listFields`, `getField` |
| SLA definitions, conditions, schedules (003, 012, 013, 137) | `contract_sla`, `cmn_schedule` | `listSlas`, `getSla`, `slaMeta` |
| Blackout / maintenance / freeze windows (085, 112, 127) | `cmn_schedule` by type, `cmn_schedule_span` (candidate) | `slaMeta` reads schedules; no type filter, no span expansion |
| Priority matrix (001, 005) | candidate `dl_u_priority` | none |
| Assignment rules (004, 029) | candidate `sysrule_assignment` | none |
| Notification rules (011) | candidate `sysevent_email_action` | none |
| UI / data policies (010, 087, 090) | candidates `sys_ui_policy(_action)`, `sys_data_policy2(_rule)` | none (`servicenow/catalogPolicy.js` handles catalog UI policies only) |
| Auto-close duration (007, 031) | candidate `sys_properties glide.ui.autoclose.time` | none |
| Knowledge suggestion (015) | UNDEFINED (candidate `cxs_table_config`) | none |
| Approval routing / workflow by type (081, 086, 091) | UNDEFINED — flows, workflows, approval rules | `servicenow/flows.js` reads `sys_hub_flow` for authoring, not for routing semantics |
| Change models, closure requirements, PIR steps (087, 092, 122) | candidates `chg_model`, `chg_model_state` | none |
| Standard change templates (080, 089, 117) | candidates `std_change_producer_version`, `std_change_proposal` | none |
| CAB (082) | candidates `cab_meeting`, `cab_agenda_item` | none |
| Conflict detection config (084, 138, 118) | UNDEFINED (candidate `conflict`) | none |
| Major-incident configuration, candidate criteria (045, 051) | UNDEFINED (MIM plugin) | none |
| Change calendar, access logs (093) | UNDEFINED | none |
| Approval delegation (088) | candidate `sys_user_delegate` | none |

**Output contract.** Configuration findings: `target_ids` are configuration
record sys_ids (a choice, a definition, a rule) or empty for an absence;
`finding_level: configuration`; `evidence` names the configuration record and
the usage figure beside it. Every read carries its own status (as
`extractCmdbMeta` does) and is stamped for the change check.

**Performance.** LOW for almost every rule — configuration tables are small.
The cost is in the usage half, delegated to the Aggregate engine. ITSM-010 is
the exception (audit-based population timing: VERY_HIGH).

**Existing code reused.** `extractCmdbMeta` / `cmdbMetaSources` pattern (bounded
reads with status, stamped); `schema.js`, `dba-schema.js`, `sla.js` readers;
`servicenow/acl.js` for the field-ACL evidence on ITSM-028.

**New functionality.** (a) A configuration-source registry: each object above
as a named reader returning rows + status; (b) `dependent_value` in the choice
read; (c) schedule-type filter and span expansion; (d) plugin-presence probing
(`tableExists` exists in `schema.js`) so a MIM/CAB/conflict rule reports
"not installed" rather than a false absence; (e) OOB baselines as data for
013/091; (f) the "used but not configured" comparison against Aggregate output.

---

## 4. Reference Integrity Engine (`reference_integrity`)

**Purpose.** Resolve a reference field to its target and judge the target's
existence, activity or lifecycle state — in batches, never per record.

**Primary rules (11):** ITSM-018, ITSM-019, ITSM-022, ITSM-044, ITSM-065, ITSM-088, ITSM-095, ITSM-101, ITSM-134, ITSM-136, ITSM-139

**Supporting (1):** ITSM-011

**Input contract.** `table`, `reference_field`, `scope` (open records),
`target` (`sys_user_group` → active membership | `sys_user` → active |
`cmdb_ci` → exists ∧ not retired | `cmdb_ci_service` → exists | `kb_knowledge`
→ published), `report_cases[]` (ITSM-019/095 report "missing" and "retired"
separately).

**Required ServiceNow data.** Distinct referenced sys_ids from the extracted
slice, then batched `sys_idIN…` reads of: `sys_user_grmember` (group→user) +
`sys_user.active`; `cmdb_ci` (already extracted — the join is in memory, but
see the cap caveat); `cmdb_ci_service` (extracted); `kb_knowledge`
(`workflow_state`, `retired`); `sys_user_has_role` (extracted for Platform).
Candidates: `sys_user_group`, `sys_user_delegate`, `m2m_kb_task`.

**Output contract.** Record findings on the REFERRING record, grouped in
evidence by target (the empty group, the retired CI), with the target's state
and — where available — its last change date.

**Performance.** MEDIUM: distinct targets are orders of magnitude fewer than
records. The one HIGH/scale-risk case is CI existence (019, 095): a dangling
reference is only provable if `cmdb_ci` was read to the end, and the 100 000-row
cap means it often is not — those two rules must gate on
`isComplete(coverage, 'cmdb_ci')` exactly as the CMDB absence rules do.

**Existing code reused.** `referenceLookup` (name → sys_id, wrong direction but
the display-field logic is reusable), the extracted `cmdb_ci` / `cmdb_ci_service`,
`DQ_INACTIVE_INSTALL_STATUS` for "retired", `isComplete` gating.

**New functionality.** (a) A batched resolver (`sys_idIN` chunks of ~50, the
size `extractCmdbMeta` already uses) with per-target caching across rules —
ITSM-018, 065, 101 and 134 must resolve group membership ONCE per run; (b) new
allow-list entries with their own specs; (c) a service-account classifier for
ITSM-022 (UNDEFINED patterns — data, not code).

---

## 5. Cross-Record Linkage Engine (`linkage`)

**Purpose.** Answer "does a related record exist, and in what state?" across
ITSM tables: incident↔problem, problem↔change, known error↔article,
change↔approval, change↔task, SLA↔service.

**Primary rules (22):** ITSM-039, ITSM-046, ITSM-047, ITSM-048, ITSM-055, ITSM-057, ITSM-060, ITSM-063, ITSM-064, ITSM-066, ITSM-069, ITSM-073, ITSM-076, ITSM-078, ITSM-109, ITSM-110, ITSM-114, ITSM-116, ITSM-122, ITSM-128, ITSM-133, ITSM-137

**Supporting (26):** ITSM-033, ITSM-035, ITSM-040, ITSM-054, ITSM-058, ITSM-061, ITSM-067, ITSM-071, ITSM-074, ITSM-075, ITSM-077, ITSM-081, ITSM-086, ITSM-088, ITSM-096, ITSM-100, ITSM-102, ITSM-106, ITSM-107, ITSM-108, ITSM-115, ITSM-117, ITSM-119, ITSM-125, ITSM-127, ITSM-138

**Existing support:** PARTIAL 14 · NONE 8. Links that are reference fields on
already-extracted tables (`incident.problem_id`, `problem.rfc`, `incident.rfc`)
are in-memory joins once the field is in the spec; links through plugin tables
(approvals, MIM communication/PIR, KB m2m, change tasks) have no reader.

**Input contract.** `from` (table, scope), `link` (`reference_field` on either
side | `m2m table` with both columns), `to` (table, scope/state filter),
`expect` (`exists` | `absent` | `count ≥ n` | `all_in_state`), `report_ratio`.

**Required ServiceNow data.** Reference fields: incident `problem_id, rfc`;
problem `rfc, known_error`; change_request `parent`. Tables to add or probe:
`sysapproval_approver` (approver, state, timestamps — ITSM-109, 110, 116, and
ITSM-100/107/108 evidence), `change_task` (backout tasks, ITSM-114),
`problem_task`, `m2m_kb_task` / `kb_knowledge` (ITSM-066, 076, 139),
`task_rel_task` (ITSM-119, if the instance links that way), MIM
communication/PIR objects (UNDEFINED — ITSM-046, 047, 052, 092, 122),
`service_offering` (extracted) for ITSM-137.

**Output contract.** Record findings on the primary record with the related
record's identity and state in evidence; for ratio forms, a `kpis[]` entry.

**Performance.** MEDIUM. Joins are between the extracted ITSM slice and a
second table restricted to the referenced ids. Two cautions: (1) the incident
slice is 90 days, so "problems with zero linked incidents" (ITSM-060) must count
via the Aggregate API over ALL incidents or it is wrong for older links;
(2) approval rows are several per change — read by `document_id IN` batches.

**Existing code reused.** The in-memory join pattern in `cmdb-correctness.js`
(change_request × cmdb_ci), `countBy` for link counts, the extracted problem and
change tables.

**New functionality.** (a) A join utility (index the target table by key once
per run; anti-join and count forms); (b) the approval-record reader and spec;
(c) plugin-object probes for MIM/PIR/CAB; (d) linkage-field discovery per
instance for the UNDEFINED links (KB, "accepted risk", "validation entry").

---

## 6. Relationship Graph Engine (`relationship_graph`)

**Purpose.** Answer graph questions over `cmdb_rel_ci` for CIs referenced by
ITSM records: edge count, dependents to depth N, directed path to a service,
support of a Business Critical service.

**Primary rules (4):** ITSM-105, ITSM-126, ITSM-130, ITSM-131

**Supporting (7):** ITSM-017, ITSM-049, ITSM-084, ITSM-115, ITSM-123, ITSM-132, ITSM-138

**Input contract.** `seed_cis[]` (from a task table's `cmdb_ci` / affected-CI
list), `question` (`degree` | `dependents(depth)` | `path_to_service` |
`supports_business_critical`), `depth` (UNDEFINED default on most rules; 2 on
ITSM-123).

**Required ServiceNow data.** `cmdb_rel_ci` (extracted, required),
`cmdb_ci_service` with `busines_criticality` (extracted), `task_ci` (candidate —
affected-CI lists for 105/126/131).

**Output contract.** Per seed CI: degree, reachable set, resolved service(s),
criticality flag — consumed by the calling rule; for ITSM-130 an aggregate
percentage; for ITSM-126 a record finding with the traversal path as evidence
(and a Lane 1 field fix via `FIX_FIELD` on `change_request.business_service`).

**Performance.** HIGH and inherently coupled to `cmdb_rel_ci` completeness:
every absence claim ("zero edges", "no path to a service") is only sound on a
complete read, so these rules gate on `isComplete(coverage, 'cmdb_rel_ci')` as
CMDB-UNRELATED does. Above the 100 000-relationship cap they cannot run.

**Existing code reused.** `synthesize()`'s adjacency map and BFS,
`cmdb-signals.buildSignals` (Business-Critical service support), the existing
CMDB-UNRELATED / REL-* rules for degree.

**New functionality.** (a) Lift the graph out of `synthesize()` into a shared,
built-once-per-run structure with directed edges (parent→child with `type`);
(b) `path_to_service` (directed, typed) and `dependents(depth)`; (c) `task_ci`
in the allow-list.

---

## 7. Audit & Journal History Engine (`audit_history`)

**Purpose.** Reconstruct events — state transitions, field changes, journal
entries, SLA pause/cancel — for a population of records, in bulk, and derive
counts, timings and gaps.

**Primary rules (8):** ITSM-026, ITSM-034, ITSM-043, ITSM-050, ITSM-056, ITSM-061, ITSM-072, ITSM-120

**Supporting (12):** ITSM-004, ITSM-005, ITSM-007, ITSM-010, ITSM-028, ITSM-030, ITSM-032, ITSM-099, ITSM-100, ITSM-106, ITSM-108, ITSM-111

**Existing support:** NONE 6 · PARTIAL 2 (the PARTIAL two are problem rules,
where the population is small enough that the per-record `auditFor()` bridge is
viable).

**Input contract.** `table`, `population` (sys_ids or an encoded query),
`source` (`sys_audit` | `sys_journal_field` | `task_sla stages`), `fields[]`
(e.g. `state`, `assignment_group`, `start_date`), `derive`
(`transition_count` | `last_change_at` | `first_set_at` | `entries_count` |
`gap_max` | `backward_transitions(order)`).

**Required ServiceNow data.** `sys_audit` (`tablename, documentkey, fieldname,
oldvalue, newvalue, sys_created_on, user`) scoped by `documentkeyIN` batches or
`tablename=incident^fieldname=state^sys_created_on>=…`; `sys_journal_field`
(`name, element, element_id, sys_created_on`) — group-by `element_id` via the
Aggregate API for counts; `task_sla` rows (`stage, pause_duration,
business_pause_duration, planned_end_time, has_breached`) for ITSM-034/035.
A state ORDER model for "backward" (ITSM-072) — UNDEFINED.

**Output contract.** Per record: the derived quantity with the audit rows that
produced it as evidence; then a record finding or an aggregate (ITSM-034's
rates) as the calling rule specifies.

**Performance.** VERY_HIGH is the norm. `sys_audit` and `sys_journal_field` are
the largest tables on most instances and are not in the allow-list. Two
disciplines make this survivable: (1) Aggregate API group-by counts where the
rule only needs a count (ITSM-026 entries, ITSM-120 reschedules); (2) restrict
row reads to the population the rule is about (major incidents for ITSM-050,
tail incidents for ITSM-032, problems for 056/061/072). Note the measured fact
in ARCHITECTURE §16.8: `cmdb_ci` is not audited on dev424910 — audit-based
rules must check `sys_dictionary.audit` / `glide.ui.audit_deleted_tables`
(`deletionLoggedTables` in `incremental.js` already does this) and skip with a
reason where auditing is off.

**Existing code reused.** `diagnostics.auditFor / journalFor / slasFor`
(per-record bridge), `deletionLoggedTables` (audit-enabled probe), `parseDate`.

**New functionality.** (a) Bulk audit/journal readers with keyset walks and
population scoping; (b) transition reconstruction; (c) `sys_audit`,
`sys_journal_field`, `task_sla` allow-list specs with slices; (d) the audit-off
skip path.

## 8. Text Analysis Engine (`text_analysis`)

**Purpose.** Normalise, compare, cluster and pattern-scan free text.

**Primary rules (11):** ITSM-021, ITSM-023, ITSM-025, ITSM-028, ITSM-040, ITSM-054, ITSM-058, ITSM-070, ITSM-071, ITSM-075, ITSM-104

**Supporting (6):** ITSM-060, ITSM-077, ITSM-080, ITSM-105, ITSM-117, ITSM-132

**Existing support:** NONE 11. Nothing in the codebase does this
(`detectDegenerateRepetition` in `acl.js` is the closest thing and is about
model output, not records).

**Input contract.** `table`, `fields[]`, `operation`
(`similarity(a, b, threshold)` | `normalised_frequency(field, min_volume)` |
`cluster(field, similarity_threshold, min_size, blocking_key?)` |
`pattern_scan(pattern_set, checksum)` | `classify(field, patterns)` |
`consistency(code_field, text_field, expected_patterns)`).

**Required ServiceNow data.** Full text of `short_description`, `description`,
`close_notes`, `cause_notes`, `backout_plan`, and for ITSM-028 journal entries
(`sys_journal_field.value`) — over the relevant slice. This is the heaviest
data the ITSM check would ever pull.

**Output contract.** Per record (similarity, classification, pattern hit
count) or per cluster (`members[], representative, volume, effort,
similarity_score`); for ITSM-028 **counts and locations only — never the
matched value** (the finding/evidence shape must have a mode that omits
`field_value`).

**Performance.** VERY_HIGH for clustering (ITSM-054, 058, 077, 132): pairwise
similarity is quadratic unless blocked (by category, by caller); HIGH for the
per-record similarity and frequency rules. Text must be read once and shared
across rules; the engine needs a memory budget and an explicit "sampled"
coverage status if it cannot process the whole slice. Every similarity
threshold is stated by the workbook (0.9, 0.85, 0.8) but the **metric is
UNDEFINED** — choosing it is a decision to record before Phase 3 implements it.

**Existing code reused.** None for the analysis. Extraction and the finding
pipeline as for other engines.

**New functionality.** (a) Normalisation (case, whitespace, punctuation,
placeholder numbers); (b) a similarity metric; (c) blocked clustering;
(d) pattern set with checksum validators and a redaction-safe evidence mode;
(e) a text-read budget and coverage status.

## 9. Temporal Correlation Engine (`temporal_correlation`)

**Purpose.** Join events across records or tables by shared CI (optionally
expanded through the graph) and a time window; intersect intervals with
schedules.

**Primary rules (10):** ITSM-027, ITSM-035, ITSM-038, ITSM-074, ITSM-106, ITSM-108, ITSM-112, ITSM-115, ITSM-123, ITSM-127

**Supporting (8):** ITSM-071, ITSM-084, ITSM-092, ITSM-111, ITSM-124, ITSM-125, ITSM-128, ITSM-138

**Existing support:** NONE 7 · PARTIAL 3 (the PARTIAL three reuse schedule
reads or change fields; the correlation itself is new everywhere).

**Input contract.** `left` (table, scope, time field, CI field), `right`
(table, scope, time field, CI field), `window` (`before(72h)` | `after(72h)` |
`overlap` | `around(30min)`), `ci_match` (`same` | `dependents(depth)`),
`aggregate` (pairs | ratio | count per CI | before/after rate); or for
schedules: `intervals` (table, start/end fields) × `schedule` (blackout /
freeze spans) → intersections.

**Required ServiceNow data.** incident (`cmdb_ci, sys_created_on, priority,
resolved_at`), change_request (`cmdb_ci, work_start, work_end, start_date,
end_date, close_code, sys_created_on, approval`), problem (`closed_at`),
`sys_audit` (ITSM-106, 108 corroboration), `task_sla.planned_end_time`
(ITSM-035), `em_alert` (ITSM-038; extracted for ITOM), `sys_attachment`
(ITSM-027), `cmn_schedule` + spans (112, 127), `cmdb_rel_ci` for expansion.

**Output contract.** Correlated pairs `{left_id, right_id, ci, delta, path?}`
with the window and depth stated on the finding (the workbook requires this
for ITSM-123); record findings on the flagged side; ratios via `kpis[]`.
ITSM-124/125 consume the pair set.

**Performance.** HIGH to VERY_HIGH. The kernel is a time-bucketed index on CI:
build once per run (changes by CI and window; incidents by CI and time), then
each rule is a probe, not a scan. ITSM-106 is the outlier — `sys_audit` over
change-controlled objects — and may be impossible where auditing is off.

**Existing code reused.** `synthesize()` graph for dependent-CI expansion,
`sla.js` schedule reads, `parseDate`, the extracted incident/change tables.

**New functionality.** (a) The CI×time index and window join; (b) interval ×
schedule-span intersection; (c) before/after windows anchored per record
(ITSM-074) — these exceed the 90-day slice and need per-record Aggregate
counts or a wider read; (d) a shared pair set consumable by composite rules.

---

## 10. Composite / Rule-Dependency Engine (`composite`)

**Purpose.** Run rules that consume other rules' outputs, or that need three or
more engines in sequence, in dependency order — passing results, not
recomputing them.

**Primary rules (9):** ITSM-007, ITSM-077, ITSM-084, ITSM-117, ITSM-124, ITSM-125, ITSM-129, ITSM-132, ITSM-138

**Supporting (0):** —

**Input contract.** `stages[]` each naming an engine and its parameters, plus
`inputs_from[]` (rule ids whose result set is consumed — see
`dependencies.consumes_output_of` in the map) and a `combine` step
(`all_breach` for ITSM-129, `re_aggregate(by)` for ITSM-124, `count_per_ci ≥ n`
for ITSM-125).

**Required data.** Whatever the stages need; no data of its own.

**Output contract.** As the final stage dictates; the finding must carry the
provenance chain (which upstream rule's result it consumed and that result's
confidence — ITSM-124/125 "inherit ITSM-123 correlation confidence").

**Performance.** Inherits the heaviest stage. The point of the engine is that
ITSM-123's correlation runs once and feeds 124, 125 and 128's evidence.

**Existing code reused.** The fixed family order in `EstateRules.analyze()` and
the `kpis` / `measures` hand-off are the only precedent; there is no
inter-rule output passing today.

**New functionality.** (a) A rule DAG with topological execution (acyclic — the
map's `consumes_output_of` edges are; `related` edges are not and must not be
used for ordering); (b) a per-run result cache keyed by rule id; (c) confidence
propagation.

---

## Cross-cutting requirements (every engine)

1. **Catalogue adapter.** `catalogueRule()` / `addCatalogued()` read the CMDB
   catalogue's camelCase, derived fields (`base` uppercased, `lane` integer,
   `kind`, `track`). The ITSM catalogue is verbatim snake_case
   (`base_severity: "Systemic"`, `remediation_lane` free text). An adapter must
   map `Systemic/Critical/High/Moderate/Low` → `SYSTEMIC/CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW`
   explicitly and leave lanes as text until a later phase decides otherwise.
2. **Threshold / parameter registry.** Every workbook threshold is
   "configurable with a default". 40+ rules have defaults; ~30 say
   "configurable" with **no default (UNDEFINED)**. The registry must hold the
   workbook default verbatim, allow an instance override, and feed the engine
   key (a changed threshold must invalidate module reuse — `engineKeys` already
   folds `staleDays` in the same way).
3. **Window manager.** Windows vary (90 d, 180 d, 72 h, 30 min, 12 months,
   "at least 3 windows"); the current single `ITSM_WINDOW_DAYS` slice cannot
   serve them, and the sliding window already defeats incremental reuse for
   ITSM (ARCHITECTURE analysis, Phase 0). Windows must be anchored per run and
   recorded on the finding.
4. **Allow-list extension.** New tables (below) each need a spec with fields
   and a slice, coverage, stamping and — for the big ones — a scoping strategy
   that is not "read it all".
5. **Finding shape extensions.** A `metric` block for aggregate findings; a
   `configuration` target kind; a redaction-safe evidence mode (ITSM-028);
   window/depth/confidence provenance; `kpis` for every ratio rule whether or
   not breached (so a rule that PASSES leaves a trace — the current pipeline
   records only failures).
6. **Plugin / capability probes.** MIM, CAB Workbench, Change Risk Assessment,
   conflict detection, Knowledge suggestion, auditing per table: a rule whose
   object is absent must skip as "not installed", never fire as "absent".
7. **Severity modifiers.** `effectiveBand` + `cmdb-signals` escalators apply;
   the workbook's ITSM-specific escalators ("duration beyond 30 days",
   "recurred after prior remediation", "involves an approval control") have no
   signal today.
8. **Scoring interface.** Out of scope here; but every engine must emit the
   `result.type` the map records (count / ratio / distribution / boolean) in a
   form a later scoring phase can consume without re-running the rule.
