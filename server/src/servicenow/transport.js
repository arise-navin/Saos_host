/**
 * Session update-set capture.
 *
 * The mechanism is the SWEEP, and the alternative was measured rather than
 * argued about (§33). Pointing the API user's `sys_update_set` preference at a
 * named set does work — but it is a per-USER setting and every NowHelpAssist
 * session shares one API user, so two interleaved sessions put 8 of 16 changes
 * in each other's set with no error anywhere. A per-session current set cannot
 * be built on it at any timing, so it is not used at all: rows are re-parented
 * after the fact, where the row's own identity decides where it goes.
 *
 * Four platform behaviours the sweep is built around, all measured:
 *
 *   1. `sys_update_xml.name` is `<table>_<sys_id of the changed record>`. That
 *      is an EXACT locator, so a tool that reports what it touched can be swept
 *      without guessing from a timestamp.
 *
 *   2. A row may only move between sets of the SAME scope. Business rule
 *      `Handle updates moving between sets` aborts anything else with a 403
 *      (trap #72). So the sweep groups by the ROW's `application` and needs one
 *      set per scope — this is enforcement, not tidiness.
 *
 *   3. REST cannot create a scoped update set: `application` is accepted and
 *      silently demoted to `global` (trap #69). Scoped sets are minted through
 *      the execution harness, where a server-side insert keeps the scope.
 *
 *   4. Only ONE row per record exists per SET, rewritten in place — but sweeping
 *      a row out and then editing the record again produces a SECOND row with
 *      the same name in the Default set. Moving that one in leaves two rows
 *      sharing a name in one set, and the platform does not dedupe. Since a
 *      payload is a complete `<record_update>` snapshot rather than a diff,
 *      collapsing to the newest is lossless — and not collapsing would make
 *      both the count and the export wrong.
 *
 * What is NOT captured, ever: task data. An incident is not configuration and
 * has no `sys_update_xml` row to sweep. That is reported explicitly rather than
 * left to look like a capture failure.
