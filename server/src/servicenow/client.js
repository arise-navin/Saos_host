 * where a 4xx means the call was wrong. It is the WRONG policy for at least one
 * endpoint we now have to call: the platform's own flow-activation processor,
 * `POST /api/now/wfa_fluent/activate_flows`, answers **HTTP 422 as a normal
 * response** meaning "every flow failed to activate", and the body carries the
 * per-flow reasons. Read from the SDK's own client
 * (sdk-api/dist/flow-activation.js:34), which deliberately parses 422 rather
 * than treating it as an error. Throwing there would discard the only
 * explanation of what went wrong.
 *
 * So this returns the response — status, parsed body, raw text — and NEVER
 * throws on an HTTP status. It throws only when the instance could not be
 * reached at all, because that is not a response.
 *
 * It is exported so the flow layer can reach a non-Table-API endpoint without
 * a second HTTP client appearing outside `servicenow/`. It is deliberately
 * low-level and deliberately narrow: `snowFetch` below is still the funnel
 * every ordinary read and write goes through, and still applies the diagnosis
