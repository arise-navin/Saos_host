/**
 * WI-3 — the SHIM CLIENT: the one and only route from an agent op to elevation.
 *
 * The model never calls the shim. It never chooses to elevate. The only path to
 * an elevated write is:
 *
 *   agent op -> mechanical (table,op) derivation -> WI-2 classifier ->
 *   WI-2 eligibility -> APPROVAL -> shim -> read the target back by nonce ->
 *   honest EXECUTED/COERCED/FAILED tier.
 *
 * This module owns that ORDER. `runGatedWrite` will not dispatch the shim until
 * an approval callback has returned approved, and it never dispatches on an
 * ineligible or fail-closed plan. Deny => nothing elevated, nothing written.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. If the eligibility read errors or times out on a gated op, the
 * plan is `blocked_read_failed` and the op is refused — never fail-open.
 *
 * NO UN-ELEVATED REVERT. On a FAILED or COERCED outcome this reports the tier
 * and STOPS. It does not attempt to undo — rollback of a gated op is itself
 * gated (WI-1) and is a separate WI.
 *
 * FORWARD create + update (WI-5), and ACL delete (WI-ACL-1). The classifier gates
 * create/update/delete so all three route through the gate.
 *
 *   - For a plain single-record gated write, create and update are implemented
 *     and delete still returns a structured fail-closed "not implemented":
 *     generic rollback of a gated op is its own WI.
 *   - For an ACL (a descriptor carrying `acl_spec`), all three are implemented,
 *     as an ATOMIC UNIT over `sys_security_acl` + `sys_security_acl_role`. Delete
 *     is not an exception carved out here — it is a first-class ACL operation,
 *     and it has to be, because the only safe response to a half-authored ACL is
 *     removing it through this same elevated channel (an un-elevated delete
 *     silently no-ops — WI-1).
 *
 * Never an un-elevated fallback, on any path.
 *
 * WI-ACL-1 adds one step to the ORDER, and its position is load-bearing: the ACL
 * SPEC is validated against the instance BETWEEN the eligibility plan and the
 * approval card. See `runGatedWrite`.
