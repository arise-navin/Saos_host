/**
 * Flow Designer module.
 *
 * READ side: flows and their parts are ordinary records —
 *   sys_hub_flow      flow / subflow headers (the `type` field distinguishes them)
 *   sys_flow_context  executions
 * plus one *family* of part tables. Current releases write the `_v2` tables;
 * older instances use the unsuffixed names. Both families exist side by side on
 * a modern instance, and the legacy tables are EMPTY for modern flows — so
 * reading the legacy names silently yields zero rows that look like "this flow
 * has no trigger". detail() therefore prefers `_v2`, falls back only when the
 * v2 tables genuinely do not exist, and always reports which family it used via
 * `sourceTables`.
 *
 * WRITE side: authoring is done with the ServiceNow SDK (Fluent) — see
 * ./fluent.js. There is still no supported REST API for inserting sys_hub_*
 * records directly, and this module never attempts it.
 *
 * Authoring tiers:
 *   1. "fluentSdk"       (shipped)  — generate Fluent TypeScript, compile it
 *                                     offline, install it. See fluent.js.
 *   2. "blueprint"       (shipped)  — LLM designs a precise build spec.
 *
 * SESSION 1 / WI-4 — the third tier is gone. A record-triggered blueprint used
 * to become an inactive Business Rule "for environments where the SDK cannot
 * run". That substituted a different artifact for the one that was asked for;
 * where the SDK cannot run the honest answer is that flow authoring is
 * unavailable, with the exact next action. A Business Rule is created only
 * when a user asks for one by name, through the ordinary gated write.

   * shortcut for "activate this flow" lying where the next person would find
   * it, and it does not activate anything: it sets `active` without a
   * published snapshot, which is the state `publishedVerdict` names
   * ACTIVE_WITHOUT_SNAPSHOT and refuses to call published. The policy already
   * refuses that write everywhere else; this closes the last door to it.

/**
 * Ask the instance to publish specific flows.
 *
 * ═══ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A RAW WRITE ═══
 *
 * A flow is published when its header names a snapshot, that snapshot row is
 * `published`, and the header is `active` — three facts that agree. Only the
 * platform can produce that state: it compiles the definition into a snapshot
 * and points the header at it. Setting `active` over the Table API produces a
 * header that claims to be on and has nothing to run, which is why that write
 * is refused everywhere in this build and why `flows.setActive` was deleted.
 *
 * So this calls the same processor SDK 4.10.1 calls after an install
 * (sdk-api/dist/flow-activation.js). It is a REST call, and it is not a raw
 * write: the endpoint is the platform's own publish operation, and what lands
 * is decided by the platform.
 *
 * ═══ EVERY DETAIL BELOW IS READ FROM THE SDK, NOT GUESSED ═══
 *
 *   the path                `api/now/wfa_fluent/activate_flows`
 *   the scope               `sysparm_transaction_scope=<sys_scope sys_id>`
 *   the body                `{ flows: [{sys_id, active: '', state: ''}], actions: [] }`
 *                           — the two empty strings are literal; the server
 *                           interprets them, and no other value has been tested
 *   422                     a NORMAL response meaning every flow failed. The
 *                           status is not the verdict; `result.summary` is
 *   "does not represent any resource"
 *                           the endpoint is absent on this instance. The SDK
 *                           logs that at DEBUG and returns silently, which is
 *                           how an install can publish nothing and say nothing.
 *                           HERE IT IS A LOUD FAILURE.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ═══
 *
 * It sends ONLY the sys_ids it is given. The SDK's own post-install task sends
 * every non-deleted key in the project (all 33 flows in this workspace today,
 * 31 of them experiments, several record-triggered on `incident`), so
 * activating through an install is an all-or-nothing act on the whole
 * application. This is scoped by construction.
 *
 * It decides nothing about success — it reports what the platform said. The
 * caller proves publication by reading the three-way proof back.
