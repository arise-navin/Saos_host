/**
 * DBA cross-cutting service — Connection / Scope / Security context (runbook §3.0).
 *
 * Every DBA tool receives this. Its only job is to decide WHAT NHA IS ALLOWED
 * TO PROMISE about reversibility on the instance that is actually connected,
 * because the rollback matrix (§1.5) is conditional on facts that differ per
 * instance and that this project's house rule says must be measured, never
 * assumed.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR MEASUREMENTS, dev428633, 2026-08-31 ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. DB ENGINE = mysql. And the way that is obtained matters, because the
 *    obvious route does not work:
 *
 *      gs.getProperty('glide.db.rdbms')  -> "mysql"     (server-side script)
 *      sys_properties name=glide.db.rdbms -> NO ROW      (Table API)
 *
 *    The property answers `gs.getProperty` but has no `sys_properties` record,
 *    so a REST search for it finds only the unrelated `auxdb.db.rdbms`. Reading
 *    the auxiliary DB's engine and reporting it as the instance's would be
 *    right by luck here and wrong on any instance where they differ. Engine
 *    detection therefore costs one server-side script execution (~2s) and is
 *    cached hard.
 *
 *    Why the engine is load-bearing: §1.5 makes recovery capability a function
 *    of it — MySQL/MariaDB = rollback + delete recovery, Oracle = rollback
 *    only, SQL Server = neither. If the engine cannot be determined this
 *    service returns `null` and every promise downgrades to "unknown", which is
 *    the honest answer. It NEVER defaults to mysql.
 *
 * 2. RECOVERY PLUGINS — and this instance is the interesting case:
 *
 *      com.glide.delete_recovery              Delete Recovery          ACTIVE
 *      com.glide.delete_recovery.partial_undelete                      ACTIVE
 *      com.snc.undelete                       Restore Deleted Records  INACTIVE
 *
 *    §1.5 says record-delete recovery needs BOTH. So the honest verdict here is
 *    neither "recoverable" nor "not recoverable": deletes ARE being captured
 *    (sys_delete_recovery holds rows in state `finished` / "Ready for
 *    Recovery", created as recently as 2026-08-30), but the plugin that
 *    provides the restore path is not installed. Reporting a flat 7-day
 *    recovery window on this instance would be exactly the confidently-wrong
 *    claim the house rules exist to prevent, so the verdict is three-state.
 *
 * 3. ROLLBACK RETENTION IS PER-CATEGORY, not the single 10 days §1.5 implies.
 *    Read live off sys_properties:
 *      glide.rollback.expiration_days_scripts_bg    10   background scripts
 *      glide.rollback.expiration_days_app_install   15
 *      glide.rollback.expiration_days_plugin        15
 *      glide.rollback.expiration_days_redact         3
 *      glide.rollback.expiration_days_inst_preview   1
 *    There is NO delete-recovery retention property on this instance, so the
 *    7-day figure stays labelled as documentation, not measurement.
 *
 * 4. `security_admin` IS NOT VISIBLE OVER REST — and that is NOT the same as
 *    absent. CORRECTED 2026-08-31: an earlier version of this file queried
 *    `sys_user_role` for name=security_admin, got zero rows, and concluded the
 *    role did not exist on this instance. That conclusion was wrong, and it is
 *    the exact interpretation this codebase already warns against: Gate 0
 *    D-2/H6 proved the role RECORD is invisible to plain REST (0 rows) while
 *    being readable server-side, which is why `elevation-gate.js` and
 *    `acl-spec.js` resolve roles through a server-side GlideRecord and never
 *    over REST.
 *
 *    So this service does not decide elevation eligibility at all. It reports
 *    that REST cannot see the role, states plainly that this is a blind spot
 *    rather than evidence, and defers: ACL authoring is attempted through the
 *    guarded elevation path and the PLATFORM'S OWN authorization result is
 *    surfaced. Pre-gating on a role REST cannot see would refuse every
 *    legitimate elevation.
