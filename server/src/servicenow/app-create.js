/**
 * WI-5 — creating a REAL custom application.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `create_record` on `sys_scope` produced a record with
 * `sys_class_name: "sys_scope"`, an empty `scope`, and no version — a husk.
 * Studio does not list it and nothing can be developed inside it. The model had
 * correctly refused one turn earlier and then complied anyway with invented
 * field values, which is why the boundary is enforced in `tools.js` rather than
 * asked for in a prompt.
 *
 * The constructive half is here. `now-sdk init` DOES create a real application:
 * it scaffolds a workspace and `install` writes a `sys_app` record — the same
 * path that produced this project's own application. The build output even names it
 * (`dist/app/scope/sys_app_<scopeId>.xml`), which is the difference between an
 * application and a husk in one filename.
 *
 * Scope naming is the part that has to be right FIRST, because a bad prefix is
 * only a warning and then the app "may not install correctly" (§3):
 *
 *   - must start with the instance's vendor prefix, read live from
 *     `glide.appcreator.company.code` — never hardcoded;
 *   - 18 characters maximum, TOTAL. With a 10-character `x_<vendor>_` prefix
 *     that leaves 8 — and the vendor prefix is issued by the instance, so the
 *     budget is computed from the live one, never from a remembered value.
 *
 * So validation happens before anything is scaffolded, and it is pure and
 * offline-testable: getting told "two characters too long" costs a second,
 * while finding out after an install costs a broken application.

 * seven failed attempts, each for a scope that will never hold anything —
 * every artifact NowForge authors lives in the workspace application
 * `x_<vendor>_nwforge`, and a second scope per request is a second place an
 * address can live (the class of defect the binding work removed).
 *
 * THE CONTRACT NOW. The scope is the workspace's, read from the tracked
 * identity file. If that application already exists on the bound instance the
 * call is REFUSED with `app_exists` as a first-class result — nothing written,
 * nothing scaffolded. If it is absent the call establishes it through
 * `establishApplication` (the existing, separately-guarded install path), which
 * is what "REQUIRES_MANUAL_ACTION with consent" means here: the tool is
 * mutating, the approval card names the install, and the read-back decides.

/**
 * WI-3 — ESTABLISH THE APPLICATION THE WORKSPACE ALREADY CLAIMS.
 *
 * ═══ THE GAP THIS CLOSES ═══
 *
 * `createApplication` scaffolds a NEW workspace directory for a NEW scope.
 * `deploy()` installs a workspace whose application ALREADY EXISTS on the
 * instance. Neither covers the state this project was actually in: a workspace
 * with 28 sources, a declared scope and a declared name, and no `sys_app` row
 * on the bound instance to install into.
 *
 * `assertAppBinding` refuses that install, correctly, and its message names the
 * remedy: "Re-establishing this application on the bound instance is a
 * deliberate action — a new scope name and a new app record — not something an
 * install should do as a side effect." This is that deliberate action. It is a
 * separate function with a separate approval, which is precisely what the guard
 * asks for.
 *
 * ═══ WHY THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE GUARD ═══
 *
 * The app-existence check is not skipped here; it is INVERTED. The ordinary
 * path refuses unless the scope EXISTS. This path refuses unless it is ABSENT.
 * The two conditions are mutually exclusive, so there is no instance state in
 * which both are permitted — nothing has been made reachable that was not
 * reachable before, and no call can choose the weaker of two checks.
 *
 * Everything else the preflight does still runs, unchanged and first:
 *   - an instance must be bound, with credentials the SDK can use;
 *   - the SDK must ECHO the same host the Table API reads (the two-tier check
 *     that catches a derivation bug);
 *   - the scope name must be legal under THIS instance's live vendor prefix.
 *
 * And the result is read back off the instance rather than parsed out of CLI
 * output, because "the CLI said it installed" is not evidence that a `sys_app`
 * row exists.
