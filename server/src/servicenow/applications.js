/**
 * Applications and scopes — read only.
 *
 * Three measurements off dev442675 (§33) shape this file, and each one would
 * produce a confidently wrong page if it were assumed instead:
 *
 *   1. `sys_store_app` answers 403 "Failed API level ACL Validation" to admin
 *      over REST — and so do `sys_package` and `sys_plugins`. Querying the
 *      table the store apps live on is therefore not an option.
 *
 *   2. They are readable anyway, through the PARENT. `sys_scope` returns all
 *      743 rows with `sys_class_name` telling you which is which: 739
 *      sys_store_app, 3 sys_app, 1 sys_scope. So one read of the parent
 *      answers the whole page, and the class name — not a second query — is
 *      what separates a custom application from a store one.
 *
 *   3. `global` has `sys_id = 'global'`, a literal, not a 32-hex GUID. Every
 *      `application` reference on an update row or update set carries that
 *      same literal, which is why nothing here validates a scope id as hex.
 *
 * The managed flag comes from the workspace registry rather than a hardcoded
 * scope, because a hardcoded platform list goes stale silently (trap #28) and
 * this one would go stale the moment a second scoped application exists.
