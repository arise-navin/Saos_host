/**
 * K1 — the ServiceNow documentation corpus: storage, and version-aware
 * retrieval over it.
 *
 * REUSED WHOLESALE from recall (A-5): the embedding call, the cosine, the
 * chunker, the float32 encoding, the FTS query builder. Nothing about
 * retrieving documentation differs mechanically from retrieving conversation,
 * and a second copy of any of those would be a second thing to keep correct.
 *
 * What IS different, and why this is not just another `kind` in `chunks`:
 *
 *   1. PROVENANCE. Every row here carries seven metadata fields, and the
 *      conflict ladder (knowledge/precedence.js) is built on being able to say
 *      "this came from documentation" as distinct from "this we measured".
 *      Merged into one table those become indistinguishable.
 *   2. VERSION. A document describes a release. A chat message does not.
 *   3. AUTHORITY. Documentation is the THIRD rung of the ladder — below live
 *      instance state and below what the tools can actually do. Keeping it in
 *      its own store is what makes that ordering enforceable rather than
 *      aspirational.
 *
 * Same degradation contract as recall: with no embedding model pulled, search
 * falls back to FTS5 keyword matching and SAYS SO, with the pull command. It
 * never returns keyword hits dressed as semantic ones.

   * leave the direct path open, which is the same mistake as guarding a tool
   * instead of the gate.
