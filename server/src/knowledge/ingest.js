/**
 * K2 — getting ServiceNow documentation into the corpus.
 *
 * THIS MODULE DOES NOT GO ON THE INTERNET, and that is a design decision rather
 * than a missing feature.
 *
 * The instruction that shaped it is "do not invent documentation or URLs". A
 * crawler is the obvious way to fill a documentation index and also the fastest
 * way to violate that: docs.servicenow.com is JavaScript-rendered and
 * paginated, so a naive fetch returns a shell, and the tempting repair — have
 * the model reconstruct the page it half-received, or synthesise the URL it
 * believes a topic lives at — produces a corpus of plausible citations that
 * nobody can distinguish from real ones after the fact. A wrong citation in
 * this system is worse than a missing one, because the agent will repeat it to
 * a user with the authority of a source.
 *
 * So documents arrive from a directory the operator fills, by whatever means
 * they trust: an official export, a licensed download, a scrape they ran and
 * checked. Every one is validated (knowledge/schema.js) and refused unless it
 * carries all seven metadata fields and a real URL.
 *
 * FILE FORMATS, both dependency-free:
 *
 *   *.json   one document object, or an array of them. Metadata at the top
 *            level, body in `text`.
 *   *.md     a `---` delimited frontmatter of flat `key: value` lines, then the
 *            body. Deliberately NOT YAML — this parser handles flat scalars and
 *            nothing else, and says so rather than pulling in a parser whose
 *            edge cases would be one more thing that can silently mis-read a
 *            source.
