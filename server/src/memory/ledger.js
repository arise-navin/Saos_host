/**
 * WI-2 — the mutation ledger.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. A compaction fired mid-turn (13,348 → 3,062
 * tokens, budget 12,081) immediately before the closing summary, and that
 * summary omitted an approved, executed record creation entirely. A user
 * approved a write at the amber gate, the write happened, and the turn's report
 * did not mention it. Nothing was lying — the model simply no longer had it.
 *
 * The fix is not a bigger budget or a better prompt. It is to stop asking the
 * model to remember what it did. Every executed mutation is appended here, and
 * the end-of-turn report is RENDERED FROM THIS TABLE. The model narrates around
 * a block it did not author and cannot omit.
 *
 * PINNED, structurally. Compaction deletes from `messages` and `chunks` and
 * touches nothing else, so no ledger row can be folded, summarised or degraded
 * by it. That is the same property that makes `tool_events` survive compaction,
 * and it is worth more than a rule someone has to keep remembering — there is
 * no code path that could remove one of these even by mistake.
