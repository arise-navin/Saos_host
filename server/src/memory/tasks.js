/**
 * PHASE 1 — the durable task/step substrate.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every agent turn is already a unit of work: it has a goal, a
 * lifecycle, and an outcome. What it has never had is an identity that outlives
 * the process. "What was this agent asked to do, and how did it end" could only
 * be answered by reading a transcript, and a transcript is exactly the thing
 * compaction is allowed to rewrite.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT, and this is the more important half. There is no planner
 * here, no decomposition, no retry, no recovery and no scheduler. One turn
 * produces one task with one step, whatever happens inside it — however many
 * provider iterations, provider retries or tool calls that turn spends. The
 * tables carry states that a later phase will drive; this phase only PROJECTS
 * the lifecycle the turn already had onto them.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. Above the execution layer and below nothing. It imports the
 * database, the actor helper and the logger, and that is the complete list —
 * no ServiceNow module, no orchestrator, no tool registry. The dependency
 * arrow runs one way (task layer -> orchestrator -> execution -> ServiceNow)
 * and `test/agent-tasks.test.js` asserts it on the import graph rather than
 * trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * WHY TRANSITION FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN UPDATES. Scattered
 * `UPDATE agent_tasks SET state = ...` is how a state column stops meaning
 * anything: every call site invents its own rules and none of them agree. The
 * functions below are the only writers, each names the transition it performs,
 * and each refuses a transition that is not legal from the current state. That
 * is deliberately not a state-machine ENGINE — it is a lookup table and a
 * guard, which is all this phase needs.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE THROWS INTO A TURN. A failure to record bookkeeping must never
 * fail the work it was recording, so every writer catches, logs loudly and
 * returns a falsy result. This is the same discipline `agent/capture.js` and
 * `memory/ledger.js` already follow, and for the same reason: by the time these
 * run, the thing being recorded has already happened.
