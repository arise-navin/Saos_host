 * A-3/A-4 — the instance knowledge ledger.

 * Everything this project learned the hard way lives in docs/fluent-research.md
 * §16, where a human can read it and the agent cannot. Each of those entries
 * cost a debugging cycle, and the agent rediscovers them from scratch in every
 * new session — or, more often, does not, and ships the confidently wrong
 * result the trap produces.
 *
 * So the ledger is seeded from those entries and injected into BOTH prompts
 * that matter: the agent's system prompt and the codegen context.
 *
 * Scope matters. A trap that is a property of the SDK or the platform holds
 * everywhere and is stored against `*`. A fact MEASURED on one instance
 * ("problem_id exists on no table here") is stored against that instance and
 * must never leak to another — a second PDI may well have the field, and a
 * confidently wrong "it does not exist" is exactly the kind of damage this
 * ledger is supposed to prevent.

 * … none of them will produce an error to warn you when violated", which is
 * a promise the truncation quietly broke.

 * by lexical overlap with the turn was built and measured against seven
 * realistic prompts and did not hold: "Add a field called warranty_expiry to
 * the incident table" ranked two ACL traps top and surfaced none of the three
 * field-write traps that request is actually about, and no single threshold
 * both kept ACL traps out of a catalog turn and returned anything at all for
 * an impersonation turn. Dropping a trap the model needed costs more than the
 * tokens, so the ledger ships whole until a selector can be shown to keep the
 * relevant fact.
 *
 * PHASE 2 IS THAT SELECTOR, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING.
 *
 * `keys` filters by the fact's own KEY, against a classification a human wrote
 * once in agent/context-capabilities.js. It is not similarity, it has no
 * threshold, and it cannot rank an ACL trap into a schema request — the failure
 * described above is unreachable by construction rather than tuned away, and
 * the context-engine suite re-runs that exact prompt as a test.
 *
 * Two properties keep it safe. A fact with no classification is treated as
 * GLOBAL, so anything a user stores at runtime through `remember_fact` is
 * always sent. And `keys` is omitted by every caller that has no context
 * profile, which reproduces the previous behaviour exactly.
 *
 * Truncation still counts against what was ELIGIBLE after filtering, so the
