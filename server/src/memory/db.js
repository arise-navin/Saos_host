 * One SQLite file for everything NowHelpAssist needs to remember: sessions,

 *
 * Why the built-in `node:sqlite` rather than better-sqlite3 — this was checked,
 * not assumed. On this machine (Node v24.18.0) the built-in covers every need:
 *
 *   DatabaseSync / StatementSync   present
 *   BLOB round-trip (Uint8Array)   works — needed for float32 embeddings
 *   FTS5 virtual tables            available — needed for the keyword fallback
 *
 * That makes the whole storage layer dependency-free, which matters here: this
 * is a Windows machine with no node-gyp toolchain, and better-sqlite3 would
 * have meant relying on a prebuilt binary matching this exact Node ABI.
 *
 * Migrations are idempotent and run on boot, keyed on `PRAGMA user_version`, so
 * starting an older or newer server against an existing file is safe.

  // 9 — sys_id PROVENANCE (follow-up WI-1)

  // WHY THIS IS AN INDEX AND NOT A SECOND SOURCE OF TRUTH.
  //
  // The obvious home for "which sys_ids does this session know about" was the
  // thing that already carries identifiers across a compaction. There isn't
  // one: `replaceSpanWithDigest` deletes from `messages` and `chunks` and
  // writes ONE row to `digests`, whose only payload is `text` — free-form
  // markdown authored by the summariser model. Its own prompt says "A mistyped
  // sys_id is worse than an omitted one — it will be used", and compaction.js
  // records a measured run where a digest dropped a flow sys_id entirely. A
  // hard block on writes cannot take its truth from the artefact it exists to
  // police.
  //
  // So every row here is written by the SAME CALL that writes the durable
  // record it is derived from — `recordToolEvent`, `appendMessage`,
  // `recordFact`. One producer per source, nothing to reconcile, nothing that
  // can drift out of step with the thing it indexes.
  //
  // It survives compaction for the same structural reason `tool_events` does:
  // compaction touches `messages` and `chunks` and nothing else.
  //
  // `row_count` is the cardinality of the RESULT SET the sys_id arrived in — a
  // read that returned five incidents registers five rows of row_count 5, and
  // "the model picked one of those and wrote to it" becomes a fact the harness
  // can check instead of a shape it has to infer from prose.
  //
  // `event_seq` defaults to -1 rather than NULL because SQLite treats NULLs as
  // distinct in a UNIQUE index, and a nullable column there would let the same
  // user-supplied sys_id insert without limit.

  // The capture agent is a separate OS-level process. It hears the meeting,
  // splits it into utterances on silence, writes each one to disk, and posts
  // the METADATA here. Audio bytes never travel over HTTP — both halves are on
  // the same machine, so a path is cheaper, debuggable (you can play any single
  // utterance back) and makes retention a directory removal rather than a
  // row-by-row sweep.
  //
  // `idx` is assigned by the AGENT at capture time, not on arrival. A short
  // utterance can finish transcribing before a long one that started earlier,
  // so arrival order is not timeline order and never will be. UNIQUE(meeting,
  // idx) is therefore both the ordering key and the idempotency key: the agent
  // may re-post an utterance after a dropped connection and get the same row.
  //
  // `text` / `speaker` are nullable and unused in this phase. They are declared
  // now so phase 2 fills a column rather than renaming a table — the migration

  // THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Without it, every run re-reports every finding
  // for ever. A team looks at 900 findings, decides 400 of them are known and
  // accepted, and has no way to say so — so the next run shows 900 again, and
  // within about three runs nobody opens the page. A health checker that cannot
  // be told "we know, and we have accepted it" is a health checker that gets
  // ignored, which is a worse outcome than a few false positives.
  //
  // KEYED ON THE FINGERPRINT, NOT THE RUN. That is the whole design. A
  // fingerprint is sha256 over rule + table + the sorted sys_ids, so it is
  // stable for the same problem on the same records across runs, and DIFFERENT
  // the moment the affected set changes. Muting "these four CIs have no owner"
  // therefore carries forward, and cannot silently suppress a fifth CI that
  // goes ownerless next week — that is a different fingerprint and comes back
  // as new.
  //
  // A STATE IS NEVER A DELETION. Muted findings are still produced, still
  // stored and still counted; the state changes how they are PRESENTED and
  // nothing else. Every state carries a reason and a timestamp, because
  // "somebody accepted this risk" is only useful if you can find out who and
