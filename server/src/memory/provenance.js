/**
 * Follow-up WI-1 — where every sys_id in this session came from.
 *
 * THE DEBT THIS CLOSES. A weak model will produce a well-formed 32-hex string
 * that no record has ever had, put it in an `update_record` payload, and the
 * gate will render it a card. `bfdd8816…` is the standing example. Nothing
 * downstream can catch it either: the write reaches a sys_id that does not
 * exist, the platform answers, and the read-back verifies whatever it finds.
 *
 * A sys_id with no provenance is not a target. That is the whole rule.
 *
 * AN INDEX, NOT A SECOND SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every row is written by the same
 * call that writes the durable record it derives from, so there is exactly one
 * producer per source and nothing to reconcile:
 *
 *   tool_result   recordToolEvent  — already holds the full result JSON, which
 *                                    is also the only place the table, the row
 *                                    count, and the number↔sys_id pairing all
 *                                    exist at once
 *   user_message  appendMessage    — written before any compaction can reach
 *                                    the message it came from
 *   ledger_fact   recordFact       — the facts table is already durable
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. A registry failure must not fail the turn it is indexing;
 * every entry point swallows and logs. The consequence of a missed write is a
 * later hard block with an honest message, which is the safe direction.

 * ordinary: create an incident, then "now assign it to the network team", and
 * the created sys_id — which exists in that result string and nowhere else —
 * was never registered, so the follow-up update was hard blocked as a
