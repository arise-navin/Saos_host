/**
 * EXPERIENCE — THE DURABLE ACTIVITY TIMELINE, REBUILT FROM THE DATABASE.
 *
 * §58 asks that a refresh reconstruct the workspace exactly, and §51 that
 * reopening a past task show what it did. Both need the same thing: a timeline
 * that does not depend on anyone having been connected while it happened.
 *
 * ═══ NO NEW QUERIES, AND NO NEW TABLE ═══
 *
 * Every read below goes through `agent/evidence/read-model.js`, which is
 * already the query layer for exactly these three sources and already carries
 * the two properties this projection needs: it is SELECT-only — there is no
 * INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or ServiceNow client anywhere in its scope — and it
 * marks each correlated row `exact`, so a row matched by session-and-window
 * rather than by task id is never presented as certainly this task's.
 *
 * Writing a second set of queries here would have been easy and would have
 * created a second answer to "what did this task do", with nothing to say which
 * was right. §73 forbids this layer owning an evidence store; reusing the query
 * layer is how that is kept true rather than merely intended.
 *
 * ═══ SEQ, AND WHY IT IS NOT A TIMESTAMP ═══
 *
 * `seq` is assigned here, by the projection, from the deterministic ordering
 * the tables already have — `agent_task_steps.sequence` and `tool_events.seq`,
 * both allocated inside their INSERT. Two events written in the same
 * millisecond have a defined order in those columns and an undefined one by
 * timestamp, so ordering by `ts` would make the timeline non-deterministic for
 * a fast plan. §10's `since` cursor is this number, which is why it has to be
 * stable across calls.
 *
 * ═══ SECRETS ═══
 *
 * §59 lists activity as one of the surfaces a credential must never reach, and
 * §18 asks for the canonical arguments to be visible. Both are satisfiable at
 * once only if the redaction happens HERE, at the boundary, rather than in the
 * client: every `metadata` object below goes through the existing redactor on
 * its way out, so there is no path by which a payload reaches the browser
 * unredacted and no second key list to fall behind.
