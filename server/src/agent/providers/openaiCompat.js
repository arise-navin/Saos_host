 *
 *   assistant content:null, WITH tool_calls   200
 *   assistant content:null, NO tool_calls     400  invalid message content

 * The OpenAI spec allows a null content beside tool_calls, and Ollama honours
 * that — but it rejects a bare null outright. So one stored assistant turn
 * with no text and no tool calls made EVERY later turn in that session fail at
 * the wire, with an error naming neither the session nor the message.
 *
 * D-7 added the second half. Coercing null to '' stopped the 400, but it also
 * made a degenerate message SENDABLE: an assistant row with empty content and
 * no tool calls goes out clean and contributes nothing but a slot the model has
 * to account for. A whitespace-only completion (a bare newline, which this
 * model emits when reasoning eats the budget) slipped through the
 * orchestrator's truthiness check and landed here as exactly that. So the shape
 * is validated, not merely coerced — and every repair is reported to the caller
