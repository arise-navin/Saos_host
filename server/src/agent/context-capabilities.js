/**
 * PHASE 2 — THE CAPABILITY TAXONOMY, AND THE THREE STATIC MAPS.
 *
 * This file is DATA. It contains no logic that can decide anything about a
 * ServiceNow operation: no policy, no approval, no execution, no I/O. It says
 * only which of the agent's tools, operating rules and measured facts belong to
 * which area of ServiceNow work, so the assembly layer can send the model the
 * part of its surface the current request is actually about.
 *
 * WHY THE MAPS LIVE HERE AND NOT ON THE TOOLS THEMSELVES. The registry contract
 * in agent/tools.js is `{ name, description, inputSchema, mutating, execute,
 * describeWrite }`, and it is consumed by the orchestrator, the approval gate,
 * the write guard and the mutation ledger. Threading a classification through
 * 90 tool literals would put a presentation concern inside the execution
 * contract and produce a diff nobody could review. A companion map keeps the
 * contract untouched — and `test/context-engine.test.js` asserts the map covers
 * the LIVE registry exactly, so it cannot silently go stale when a tool is
 * added.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS ALWAYS "INCLUDE". An unclassified rule is global. An
 * unclassified fact is global. An unclassified tool is a test failure rather
 * than a silent exclusion. Every direction of doubt resolves toward the model
 * seeing MORE, because the cost of a missing tool is a broken turn and the cost
 * of a missing safety rule is a wrong write, while the cost of an extra one is
 * some tokens.

 * `core` is not a domain. It is the set every profile receives: reading schema,
 * resolving references, reading records, and reaching memory and documentation.
 * Almost every operating rule assumes those are available — rule 1 requires

/**
 * THE RULE THIS MAP FOLLOWS, discovered by getting it wrong twice.
 *
 * A tool is tagged with the DOMAIN it belongs to, and with a CROSS-CUTTING
 * capability only when it is that capability's own generic surface.
 *
 * The cross-cutting ones — `record_mutation`, `verification`, `build`,
 * `deployment`, `schema_read`, `reference_analysis`, `dependency_analysis` —
 * describe what a tool DOES, not where it lives. Used as selectors on a domain
 * tool they leak that whole domain into every request that implies them:
 * tagging `create_sla` with `record_mutation` exposed it on any incident
 * update; tagging `verify_sla_live` with `verification` exposed it on any flow
 * task, because authoring a flow implies verifying one; tagging
 * `create_flow_live` with `build` exposed it on any column change.
 *
 * So those capabilities still drive RULE and FACT selection, where "this turn
 * involves verification" is exactly the right question — and they select tools
 * only through `core` and the three generic record tools. A domain's tools come
 * from the domain, and from nowhere else.
 *
 * `dependency_analysis` reaches the DBA tools the same way, through IMPLIES
 * rather than through a tag: asking what depends on a table implies `dba`, and
 * `dba` selects the tools. Tagging them as well would be redundant, and a
 * redundant tag is the shape the leaks above started as.

 * the turn was built, measured against seven realistic prompts, and did not
 * hold — "Add a field called warranty_expiry to the incident table" ranked two
 * ACL traps top and surfaced none of the three field-write traps that request
 * is actually about. The conclusion drawn there was that the ledger ships whole
 * "until a selector can be shown to keep the relevant fact".
 *
 * A key map is that selector. It cannot rank an ACL trap into a schema request,
 * because relevance is declared once, by a human, against the fact's identity —
 * not recomputed per turn from a similarity score. The suite re-runs that exact
 * failing prompt as a test.
 *
 * A fact with no entry here is GLOBAL. That covers every fact a user adds at
 * runtime through `remember_fact`, every fact `recordVerificationFailure`
 * writes, and any seed added later without a classification.
