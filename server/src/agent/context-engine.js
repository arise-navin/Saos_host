/**
 * PHASE 2 — THE CONTEXT ENGINE.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. An assembly layer. It decides what the model is SHOWN — which
 * tools, which operating rules, which measured facts, which retrieval query —
 * and it decides nothing else. It has no opinion about whether a mutation is
 * allowed, whether an approval is valid, whether an elevation may proceed or
 * whether a write succeeded. Those questions belong to the orchestrator's
 * gates, the write guard, the elevation shim and the read-back verifier, all of
 * which sit BELOW this and none of which this imports.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST. A narrower tool list is not a narrower
 * permission. If `create_sla` is not in a profile, that means "the model was
 * not shown create_sla on this invocation" and it means nothing else: the
 * approval gate, the provenance requirement and the mutation ledger are
 * unchanged and still authoritative for every tool that DOES run. Context
 * selection can make the model less likely to try something; it can never make
 * something permitted that was not, and it can never make something forbidden
 * that was. `test/context-engine.test.js` asserts that directly.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Measured on the live registry and the live prompt, the fixed
 * per-invocation cost was 31,759 tokens against a 60,000-token self-imposed
 * ceiling — 20,856 of it tool schemas, 6,079 the fact ledger, 4,263 the
 * operating rules. Better than half the envelope was spent before a word of
 * conversation, on a surface that is mostly irrelevant to any given request: an
 * incident lookup was carrying the ACL authoring rules, the catalog UI-policy
 * traps and 36 DBA tool schemas.
 *
 * FAILURE DIRECTION. Every default here is "include". An unclassified tool,
 * rule or fact is sent. An unrecognised request is sent everything, loudly. The
 * engine is allowed to make the prompt smaller only where a human has said in
 * advance that it may.
