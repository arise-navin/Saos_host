/**
 * B7 — the missing caller.
 *
 * B1 built the wrapper, B5 built provenance, B6 built the honest chip, and none
 * of them had a write path to act on: `runImpersonated` had no write mode and no
 * mutating tool routed through it. This is that path, and it is the highest-risk
 * operation in the feature — a mutation that persists on a real instance,
 * attributed to a real person, with every measured trap live at once.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN:
 *
 *   1. INTENT is recorded before the instance is touched. A crash after this
 *      point leaves a row with no change (untidy); recording afterwards would
 *      risk a change with no row (unanswerable). Provenance is the thing that
 *      must not be lost, so it is written first.
 *   2. The wrapper asks the operation's OWN capability flag and does not
 *      dispatch a write it will refuse. Nothing throws on denial here, so a
 *      write that was never going to land has to be decided about in advance.
 *   3. On success the write is read back twice — as the target (can they see
 *      what they did?) and as admin (what does the instance say they did?) —
 *      and the intent is CONFIRMED with what the instance actually stamped
 *      rather than with what we intended it to stamp.
 *   4. A refusal ABORTS the intent. "We decided not to" and "we do not know
 *      whether it happened" are different facts and never share a state.
