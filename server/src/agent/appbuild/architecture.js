/**
 * PHASE 20 — REQUIREMENTS INTO COMPONENTS (§8, §16–§27).
 *
 * The architect turns "employees request equipment and a manager approves" into
 * a list of artifacts with dependencies. A model proposes the shape, because
 * mapping prose onto artifacts is reading comprehension; the platform then
 * refuses everything it cannot stand behind, which is most of what this file
 * is.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT IS VALIDATED, AND WHY EACH ONE EXISTS ═══
 *
 *   §16  a field TYPE must be one the platform actually has. The semantic
 *        layer's type vocabulary is read for this rather than a list written
 *        here — "do not guess field types" is unenforceable against a guess
 *        this file made itself.
 *   §17  a scoped NAME must satisfy the real naming rules, checked with the
 *        existing `validateScopeName` and the real vendor prefix. No hardcoded
 *        universal ServiceNow naming assumption appears anywhere below.
 *   §18  a name that collides with an existing artifact STOPS the build.
 *   §21  a reference field must name a target that exists or is being built.
 *        A dangling reference is refused rather than created.
 *   §22  a choice is `{value, label}`. Assuming label equals value is the
 *        commonest way a choice list ends up wrong, so it is refused.
 *   §23  a role is named explicitly and scoped. No broad grant is inferred.
 *   §24  an ACL names its table, operation and role explicitly.
 *   §25  the security model is REPORTED, and an application with no read rule
 *        is flagged rather than silently left open.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT THE ARCHITECT NEVER DECIDES ═══
 *
 * Whether any of it can be BUILT. That is `capability.js`, against discovery,
 * and keeping it out of here is what stops a confident architecture from
 * implying a possible build.
