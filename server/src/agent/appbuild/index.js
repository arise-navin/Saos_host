/**
 * PHASE 20 — THE APPLICATION BUILDER, ASSEMBLED.
 *
 * §2 is the whole design: this is an orchestrator and a composer, and it must
 * not become a second client, executor, verifier, approval mechanism or
 * deployment system. Read `buildApplication` and every one of those is CALLED:
 *
 *   capability discovery  `discoverAll`, injected
 *   the naming rules      `validateScopeName` / `vendorPrefix` (Phase 9)
 *   the plan              `generatePlan` with a deterministic `propose`,
 *                         `validatePlan`, `savePlan`, `buildReview` (Phase 4)
 *   approval              the existing card and gate, untouched
 *   execution             `executePlan` — §64, non-negotiable
 *   verification          read-back, injected
 *   linting               `lintFlow` (Phase 16)
 *   the change summary    Phase 18's categories and risk table
 *   knowledge             `knowledgeFor` (Phase 19)
 *   the runtime test      `testFlow` (Phase 17)
 *
 * ═══ THE ORDER IS THE SAFETY ARGUMENT ═══
 *
 *   read requirements → discover → architect → validate → graph → capability
 *   → GATE → lint → change → knowledge → plan → review → approve → execute
 *   → verify → test
 *
 * The GATE is where §29 lives: nothing is written until every component has
 * been resolved against this instance. On an environment without the SDK the
 * run stops there, having designed the whole application, and writes nothing.
 * That is the dominant outcome on dev424910 and it is a correct one.
