/**
 * PHASE 20 — CAN THIS ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY BUILD IT? (§12, §28, §29)
 *
 * ═══ THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING ═══
 *
 * §29: "validate ALL components/capabilities before writing ANY component."
 *
 * That is not a preference. Building an application is not one mutation, it is
 * ten or forty, and the failure mode §29 describes — creating six artifacts and
 * then discovering at step seven that the SDK is unavailable — leaves a real
 * instance holding half an application that nobody designed and no rollback can
 * honestly undo. §68.3 makes mutating before validating the complete
 * architecture a release blocker, and this file is where that is enforced:
 * `gate` returns EXECUTABLE only when every component is executable.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "build what you can" mode. A partial application is
 * not a smaller application; it is a broken one.
 *
 * ═══ WHERE A STATUS COMES FROM ═══
 *
 * `capability-discovery`, and nothing else. Not the plan, not the model, not a
 * cached answer, not the shape of the component. §68.10 makes a model inventing
 * a capability a release blocker, and the defence is that the model has no path
 * into this file — `discovered` is passed in by the caller and read.
