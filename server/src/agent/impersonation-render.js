/**
 * B6 — renderer honesty for impersonation.
 *
 * TWO JOBS, both of which are about not saying something untrue:
 *
 *   1. The chip. A human must never have to remember whose authority the thing
 *      in front of them carries.
 *   2. Denial labels. A blocked operation must be labelled by its actual cause,
 *      because "Aagamya cannot see this" and "this table refuses cross-scope
 *      writes" are different facts about different subjects, and mislabelling
 *      the second as the first invents a claim about a person.
 *
 * WHY THE CHIP IS NOT SIMPLY "AS <user> (impersonated)".
 *
 * The build pack specifies that wording on every approval card and result line
 * while mode is active. Taken literally it would be false today, in exactly the
 * way B5 caught: no mutating tool routes its write through the impersonation
 * wrapper, so `update_record` executes over REST as the NowHelpAssist service
 * account even while mode is on. A card reading "AS aagamya.tanwar" over a
 * write that will be stamped `admin` is the confidently-wrong failure this
 * project exists to prevent — and it is worse on an approval card than
 * anywhere else, because it is the moment a person is deciding.
 *
 * So the chip reports mode AND what this particular operation actually
 * executes as. When an operation genuinely runs impersonated it says so in the
 * pack's words; when it does not, it says that instead. The two are never
 * spelled the same way.

/**
 * Label a denial from the PRE-FLIGHT capability booleans.
 *
 * Phase 0 measured this the hard way: across ten cross-scope and ACL-denied
 * operations, NOTHING THREW. Not a denied read, not a denied write, not a
 * cross-scope block. There are no denial strings on this platform to match on,
 * so there is nothing to parse and no exception to inspect — which is why the
 * capability booleans have to be read BEFORE the operation rather than after it
 * fails, because it will not fail.
 *
 * TWO DISCRIMINATORS, in order of how much they are worth.
 *
 * BEST — the ADMIN BASELINE (B7). The wrapper reads the same table's flags as
 * admin, before switching, in the same execution. Refused for admin too means
 * the TABLE refuses the operation; refused only for the target means the target
 * does. This is direct evidence rather than inference, and it is used whenever
 * the caller supplies it.
 *
 * FALLBACK — `canRead`, for callers with no baseline (a bare pre-flight, or a
 * cached one). Layer-1 typically refuses the operation while leaving the table
 * readable (measured: `canRead: true`, everything else false, on a
 * caller_access=2 table from the global harness); Layer-2 usually removes sight
 * of the rows entirely (measured: `canRead: false` for a role-less impersonated
 * user, secure query iterating zero rows).
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS A HEURISTIC AND IS KNOWN TO BE WRONG SOMETIMES. Measured on
 * `sys_user`: the impersonated target has `canRead: true`, `canWrite: false` —
 * the Layer-1 signature — but the cause is their own ACLs, because admin writes
 * that table freely. That is why the baseline exists and why it wins when
 * present. A caller that can supply `adminPreflight` should.
 *
 * `canRead: true` with everything else also true is not a denial at all.
