 * These compose the earlier phases rather than re-deciding anything:
 * B2 says who is eligible, B1 says what the instance actually reports, and the
 * mode table holds the answer between turns.
 *
 * WHAT "MODE" IS, EXACTLY. Under M1 there is no persistent ServiceNow session —
 * each wrapper execution impersonates, acts and reverts inside one bounded job.
 * So starting mode changes nothing on the instance. It records which target the
 * NEXT execution will stamp. Saying it any other way would invite a reader to
 * believe a session is sitting open somewhere, and none is.
 *
 * WHY START IS `mutating: true` AND END IS NOT. Start escalates: it decides
 * whose authority subsequent instructions carry. End de-escalates, and gating
 * de-escalation only makes it likelier that someone stays impersonating because
 * dismissing a dialog was easier.

 * WI-IMP-2 — what the approval card must know BEFORE a human is asked.
 *
 * ── The ordering defect this exists to fix ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Eligibility used to run entirely inside `execute`, which is AFTER the approval
 * gate. Measured front-door on an administrator target: the card appeared, the
 * human approved, and only then did the gate refuse `target_holds_admin_role`.
 * The card could not have said the target was an admin, because nothing had
 * asked yet.
 *
 * Two consequences, and neither is cosmetic:
 *   1. An approval was spent on a decision that was already going to be refused
 *      — the WI-3 lesson, and the WI-ACL-1 lesson one layer over.
 *   2. Worse: the second round-trip, with `elevated_approval: true`, produced a
 *      card visually IDENTICAL to impersonating any ordinary user. The one
 *      signal distinguishing "act as an administrator" from "act as a
 *      contractor" was a boolean inside a JSON payload, with the same weight as
 *      the task string. The flag's stated purpose is to make an admin target
 *      impossible to approve INATTENTIVELY, and rendered that way it could not
 *      do that job.
 *
 * So the gate now runs twice: here, to inform the card and to refuse before it;
 * and again inside `execute`, which stays authoritative. Re-running rather than
 * passing the verdict forward is deliberate — this preview is for the human, not
 * for the decision, and a preview that could be handed to `execute` as a
 * clearance would be exactly the inherited-clearance hole A3 forbids. If the two
 * ever disagree (a role revoked in between), `execute` refuses and the preview
 * was merely optimistic.
 *
 * Costs one extra bounded execution per start/switch. For the operation that
 * decides whose authority everything afterwards carries, that is worth paying.
