 * WI-3 — the ELEVATION GATE, wired into the mutation path.
 *
 * A write to a security_admin-gated table (sys_security_acl CRUD) CANNOT land
 * un-elevated (WI-1). So instead of the normal REST executeTool path — which
 * would silently no-op — a gated op is routed here, and this is the ONLY route
 * to elevation. The model has no elevate verb; it cannot reach the shim; it
 * cannot bypass this gate or force a plain-GR fallback.
 *
 * Order enforced by the shim client: mechanical (table,op) derivation ->
 * classifier -> eligibility -> APPROVAL -> shim -> target read-back -> tier.
 * Refuse/fail-closed happen BEFORE approval; deny => nothing elevated. No
 * un-elevated revert on any failure path.
 *
 * Returns `{ handled, cancelled }`. `handled` is true when it fully handled the
 * call (result + audit pushed); `cancelled` says the turn was stopped while this
 * elevation was at the gate, which the caller must not treat as a denial.
 *
 * FLAG #3 — GUARD-SUPERSET AUDIT. Routing around the normal permission gate must
 * ADD protection, never remove it. Every guard the ordinary mutation path applies:
 *   - confabulated-sys_id block (checkWriteTarget), known-drop/user-rejected
 *     (checkBeforeGate), plan-time trap (planTimeTrapCheck): run BEFORE this
 *     interception in the loop, so a gated op still passes all three. NOT skipped.
 *   - approval + 32-byte nonce + awaitApproval: PRESENT here (own enriched card).
 *   - mutatingCallCount increment: PRESENT (at the call site).
 *   - recordToolEvent, appendMutation (ledger), recordRejection on deny: PRESENT.
 *   - verifyMutation: replaced by the read-back TIER, which is a cross-transport
 *     verification — stronger, not weaker.
 *   - recordDrops: N/A — the REST silent-drop registry; COERCED/mismatches carry
 *     the equivalent for the elevated path.
 *   - appendImpersonatedMutation: N/A — elevation is not impersonation.
 *   - captureAfterTool: N/A — the elevated write runs in a background job, not the
 *     REST transport window; its sys_update_xml is recorded provenance, not swept.
 *   - emit tool_use: N/A — the elevation bubble is its own render (WI-4).
 *   - recordVerificationFailure: N/A — it early-returns for anything but
 *     verify_flow_live (memory/facts.js).
 *   - PHASE 0 cancellation: PRESENT, and it ADDS to the superset rather than
 *     relaxing it. The card here takes the same signal as the normal gate, and
 *     a cancelled wait is reported as cancelled rather than denied — so no
 *     `recordRejection` is written for a decision nobody made. Nothing is
 *     elevated and nothing is written on that path, identically to a denial.

 * Permanent", the model resolved the item, read its variables, quoted the two
 * correct sys_ids and the correct choice value in a tidy table — and then
 * ended the turn with "Shall I create this UI Policy now?".
 *
 * Nothing was created, and nothing said so. From the outside a stalled turn
 * looks exactly like a completed one: prose arrives, the stream closes.
 *
 * Asking harder does not fix it. The system prompt already said the approval
 * gate IS the confirmation and to call the tool; the model asked anyway, which
 * is §20's lesson again — three attempts of prose had not moved this model, and
 * one dictionary listing moved it immediately. So this is a guard, and the
 * evidence it feeds back is the thing the model demonstrably did not have: the
 * fact that its question reached nobody.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It fires only when ALL of:
 *   - the turn is ending with no tool call at all,
 *   - the assistant's last line asks to proceed,
 *   - the user's own message was an instruction to change something,
 *   - and it has not already fired this turn.
 * A genuine clarifying question ("which of these two items did you mean?") does
 * not match, because it does not ask for permission to proceed.
