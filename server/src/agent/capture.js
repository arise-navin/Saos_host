/**
 * The capture hook — what runs after a mutating tool succeeds.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * **Capture must never break the turn.** By the time this runs the tool has
 * already written to the instance. A sweep that threw would turn a successful
 * change into a failed turn while leaving the change in place, which is the
 * worst of both. Everything is caught, and a failure is reported as a capture
 * failure rather than a tool failure.
 *
 * **A non-config mutation must SAY so.** Creating an incident produces no
 * `sys_update_xml` row, so a capture that simply found nothing is
 * indistinguishable from one that silently failed. The audit row says
 * "not captured — data, not configuration" and names the table, which is the
 * difference between a feature you can trust and one you cannot.
 *
 * Targets are derived without a per-tool table map: `harvestSysIds` already
 * pulls record ids out of arbitrary tool results for the audit page, and the
 * sweep can locate an update row from a bare sys_id (`nameENDSWITH`), so the
 * hook never needs to know which table a given tool writes to.
 */

/**
 * Tables a tool is known to write, used ONLY to explain a non-capture.
 *
 * This is not how the capture verdict is reached — that comes from what the
 * sweep actually found on the instance. It exists so the audit row can say
 * *why* nothing was captured, and it is small on purpose: an entry that goes
 * stale makes a message less specific, never a result wrong.
