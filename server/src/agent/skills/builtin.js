/**
 * SKILLS — THE SEVEN BUILT-IN SKILLS.
 *
 * §39 is unusually specific about what these are and are not: "Existing domains
 * should become built-in skills only as a presentation/registry mapping
 * initially. Do not duplicate the existing implementation. The skill registry
 * points to existing capabilities."
 *
 * So every entry below is a POINTER. Each names capabilities that already exist
 * in `agent/context-capabilities.js` and rules that already exist in the prompt
 * layer; not one line of Incident Operations, the Doctor, NowLint, NowTest,
 * Change Intelligence, Knowledge or the Application Builder is restated here,
 * and disabling one of these does not remove an implementation — it removes the
 * capabilities from the planner's view, which is what §41 asks for.
 *
 * WHY CAPABILITIES AND NOT TOOL LISTS. A tool list would be a second copy of
 * `TOOL_CAPABILITIES`, and a second copy is a thing that falls behind: add a
 * tool to the incident domain and the skill would silently stop covering it.
 * Naming the CAPABILITY means the skill covers whatever that capability covers
 * today, and `test/experience-skills.test.js` asserts every capability named
 * here exists in the live taxonomy.
 *
 * The `tools` list is therefore left EMPTY on purpose for every built-in. It
 * exists in the manifest schema for user-installed skills that want to name a
 * specific tool; a built-in that filled it in would be pinning itself to a
 * snapshot of the registry.
 */

/**
 * The declared `permissions` are informational only (§32). What each skill can
 * actually do is computed from its capabilities against the live registry by
 * `permissions.js`, and the UI shows the computed answer — these strings are
 * the human-readable gloss beside it, and a test asserts the gloss cannot claim
 * a change capability the computation does not find.
