/**
 * A1 — deterministic decoding for structured generation.
 *
 * Codegen and verification-spec generation are not creative tasks: the same
 * spec should produce the same source. Both knobs that buy that are requested
 * here and PASSED THROUGH by the adapters to whatever the provider supports.
 *
 * What is actually honoured is a provider/model property, and it was measured
 * rather than assumed (docs/fluent-research.md §19). On this machine's only
 * available model, `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` via Ollama:
 *
 *   - `seed` is IGNORED. Not dropped by the OpenAI-compat shim — ignored by the
 *     backend: three calls to the NATIVE /api/chat with identical
 *     `options.seed` at temperature 1.0 returned three different answers.
 *   - `temperature: 0` is only APPROXIMATELY stable. Repeated identical calls
 *     share a prefix and then diverge, which is what batched GPU inference
 *     looks like when two candidate tokens are near-tied.
 *
 * So nothing downstream may ASSUME reproducibility. These values are requested
 * because a stronger model swapped in through Settings may well honour them,
 * and because temperature 0 measurably narrows the spread even here. Every
 * guard in the pipeline is written to hold when decoding is non-deterministic,
 * which is the state this repo is actually in.
