/**
 * PHASE 4 — THE PLAN EXECUTOR.
 *
 * IT OWNS ORDERING AND NOTHING ELSE. Every control this project has stays
 * exactly where it was and is called, not reimplemented:
 *
 *   the tool registry        toolMap
 *   the approval gate        awaitApprovalDecision + resolveApproval + executeTool
 *   the write guards         checkWriteTarget, checkBeforeGate
 *   the mutation pipeline    snapshotBefore, verifyMutation, attachVerification
 *   provenance               appendMutation, recordToolEvent
 *   transport capture        captureAfterTool
 *
 * `executeTool` is the important one. It refuses any mutation whose approval is
 * not both resolved AND attributable, so this executor cannot run a write by
 * deciding it is fine — it has to produce a real `user_click` decision from the
 * real gate, exactly as the turn loop does.
 *
 * THE FINGERPRINT IS CHECKED BEFORE EVERY STEP, not once at the start. An
 * approval authorises a specific plan; a plan edited afterwards is a different
 * plan nobody approved. Checking once would leave the whole rest of the run
 * inheriting a binding that no longer describes it.
 *
 * NO RECOVERY, NO RETRIES, NO ROLLBACK. A failed step fails the plan, loudly,
 * with the reason. Phase 4 deliberately stops there: retrying a mutation whose
 * outcome is unknown is how a duplicate record gets created, and undoing a
 * partial run needs a rollback model this project does not have yet.

     * — and that reference is what was fingerprinted and what a human approved.
     * The value it names does not exist until the producer has run, so it is
     * supplied now, from the producer's own recorded output.
     *
     * THIS IS NOT POST-APPROVAL NORMALISATION. Nothing about the plan is
     * rewritten or repaired: the stored plan still says `$ref`, the approval
     * still binds that reference, and every resolved value is traceable to the
     * declared reference it came from. What a person authorised was "the record
     * step 1 finds", and that is precisely what runs.
     *
     * IT IS ALSO NOT A SECOND EXECUTION PATH. Resolution produces arguments and
     * stops. `runStep` below is the same function, with the same guards, gate,
     * verifier and ledger — it simply receives a step whose references have
     * become values.
     *
     * EVERY FAILURE STOPS. A producer that failed, was cancelled, or never
     * recorded the output leaves the reference unresolved, and an unresolved
     * reference fails the step. Nothing is substituted for a missing value.
