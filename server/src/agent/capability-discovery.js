/**
 * PHASE 3 — CAN THIS INSTANCE ACTUALLY DO THIS, THROUGH A SUPPORTED MECHANISM?
 *
 * NOT "does a tool exist". That distinction is the entire reason this file is
 * separate from the tool registry. `create_flow_live` is in the registry on
 * every machine; it works only where the SDK is installed, authenticated and
 * pointed at the bound instance. A capability layer that answered from the
 * registry would report flow authoring available on a laptop with no CLI, and
 * the planner built on top of it would produce plans that cannot run.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC, AND NO MODEL IS CONSULTED. Every answer comes from
 * configuration, the tool registry, the SDK's own cached probe, and the
 * deterministic role classifier. There is no prompt here and there must never
 * be one: "can this be done" is a question about a machine, and asking a
 * language model to guess at it is how a fabricated capability gets into a plan.
 *
 * IT DESCRIBES; IT NEVER ACTS. Nothing here installs, writes, elevates or
 * approves. In particular elevation is REPORTED as a requirement and is never
 * performed — Phase 3 says what a capability would need, and the existing
 * elevation shim remains the only thing that can grant it.
 *
 * NON-BLOCKING. The SDK probe costs ~8 seconds of CLI start-up, so this reads
 * `cachedCapability()`, which returns what is already known and refreshes in
 * the background. A cold cache produces `unknown` rather than a stall — and
 * `unknown` is a real answer here, not a failure.
