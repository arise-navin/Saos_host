 *
 *   1. A file another process holds open cannot be deleted. If the user has
 *      just played an utterance back, the browser may still hold that handle,
 *      and `rm -rf` fails on that one file while removing its siblings.
 *   2. `fs.rmSync(..., { force: true })` swallows exactly that error. A delete
 *      that "succeeded" while leaving voice recordings on disk is the worst
 *      outcome available here, because the UI would then say the audio was
 *      removed and nobody would ever look again.
 *
 * So the removal is followed by a re-read of the directory, and what is
 * reported is what the filesystem says afterwards — not what the call returned.
 * A partial delete is a LOUD failure with the surviving paths named, and the
 * caller keeps `audio_dir` set so the meeting still counts as holding bytes.
