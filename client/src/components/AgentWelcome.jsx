 * THE NEW-CHAT STATE.
 *
 * Content on the waves, not a card on the waves. There is no border, no
 * panel and no surface here — the playground background IS the background, and
 * everything below is centred type sitting directly on it.
 *
 * PRESENTATION ONLY, and now content-free: a mark, a cycling headline and one
 * sentence. It takes no props, holds no session state and calls nothing —
 * there is no longer any path from this component into a turn.
 */

/*
 * Phrases, deliberately about work this product actually does on a ServiceNow
 * instance — no "what can I help you with", no "unlock your potential".
 *
 * They are also all 23-25 characters. StrokeText scales its SVG to the width
 * of its container, so a short phrase would render visibly LARGER than a long
 * one; keeping the lengths close is what stops the headline from jumping size
 * every time it cycles.

/*
 * THE ONLY THING THAT CYCLES.
 *
 * The interval and the index live in HERE, not in the parent, so a phrase
 * change re-renders this component and nothing else — the description below it
 * and the mark above it are never touched by the timer. memo() holds
 * that line from the other direction too: AgentChat re-renders on plenty of
 * things, and none of them should restart the animation.
 *
 * The `key` is what replays it. StrokeText draws on mount, so giving it a new
 * key per phrase remounts it and runs the stroke animation again — which is
 * the transition between phrases rather than a crossfade bolted on top.
