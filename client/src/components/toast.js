/**
 * D-2 — transient feedback, in one place.
 *
 * The seam is a module-level store rather than a React context on purpose.
 * Toasts get raised from event handlers, from `.catch()` blocks, and from SSE
 * callbacks that outlive the render that started them; threading a context
 * through all of those would have meant touching every call site to add a
 * hook, which is exactly the churn `confirm.js` was written to avoid.
 *
 * It is also why this is a store and not a "register a sink" callback: React
 * runs effects child-first, so a page that toasts from its own mount effect
 * would fire BEFORE the host at the app root had registered. Queuing in a
 * plain array means an early toast is rendered late, never dropped.
 *
 * Inline notices are NOT replaced wholesale. The rule applied across the app:
 * transient outcomes ("saved", "reordered", "deleted") become toasts; anything
 * a person needs to read while fixing a form — validation, a diagnostic, a
 * capability banner — stays inline where the problem is.
