/**
 * What the header pill says, decided in plain JS.
 *
 * Split out of the component for the same reason instanceState.js is: this is
 * the part carrying a rule, and a rule that cannot be rendered in the offline
 * suite is a rule nobody is checking. Node cannot import `.jsx`.
 *
 * The rule is the honesty rule the whole product runs on: `unknown` is its own
 * answer and must never be shown as health. "Nothing disagreed" and "nothing
 * was compared" look identical unless something states which it is — the same
 * distinction listIndexes refuses a false zero for, and the same one
 * describeInstanceState draws between an empty page and an unreadable one.
