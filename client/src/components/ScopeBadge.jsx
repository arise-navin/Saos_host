/**
 * The scope an artifact belongs to, as a mono badge.
 *
 * One component wherever a scope is shown, so Flows, Catalog, SLA and Access
 * cannot drift into four spellings of the same fact. It renders the scope NAME
 * (`x_2002152_nwforge`, `global`) rather than the application's display label,
 * because the scope name is the address — it is what prefixes an artifact, what
 * `now.config.json` claims, and what decides which update set a change can move
 * into. The friendly name goes in the tooltip.
 *
 * An unresolved sys_id is shown as itself, truncated. A badge that silently
 * emptied would be indistinguishable from an artifact with no scope, and the
 * two are different facts.
