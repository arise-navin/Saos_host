/*
 * The seam between the Agent page and the global sidebar.
 *
 * The chat list, the task history, the skills panel and the two turn switches
 * are DRAWN in the app's left column but still OWNED by the Agent page, because
 * that is where every piece of state behind them already lives — the session
 * id, the loaded list, the search hits, the running flag that makes rows inert
 * mid-turn, the capture and auto-approve values re-read on every session
 * switch. Lifting all of that into App to move four panels would have rewritten
 * working functionality to change its position, and there is one functional
 * implementation of it, not two.
 *
 * So AgentChat keeps its markup exactly as it was and portals each piece into
 * the slot the sidebar renders for it. React tree unchanged, DOM position
 * changed: state, events and context all still flow from AgentChat, which is
 * what a portal is for.
 *
 * FOUR slots rather than one, because the navigation now files these under
 * different headings — chats and tasks under CHATS, skills and the switches
 * under SETTINGS — and a single blob could only ever land in one of them.
 *
 * The slots are looked up in an effect rather than during render. The sidebar
 * and the page mount in the same commit, so the nodes do not exist yet while
 * AgentChat is rendering; effects run after the whole tree is in the DOM, by
 * which time they do. `deps` re-resolves a slot when the sidebar rebuilds one
 * — collapsing the column unmounts the expanded panes, and the portal has to
 * find the new node rather than keep pointing at the detached one.
