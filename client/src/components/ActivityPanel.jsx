/**
 * THE AGENT'S ACTIVITY, AS A LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED.
 *
 * §5 asks the workspace to answer "what is it doing, what has it done, what is
 * it waiting for" without reading server logs, and §66 forbids answering with
 * anything that is not a real event. Every row below came from a frame the
 * backend emitted or a row it stored; there is no timer, no simulated progress
 * and no state this component advances on its own.
 *
 * §3 — NO PRIVATE REASONING. The titles are operational: "query_records",
 * "Approval required", "Verification: verified". There is no place in this
 * component where model deliberation could be rendered, because none is sent.
 *
 * ═══ RECONNECT AND REFRESH (§10, §11, §58) ═══
 *
 * The live rows come from the stream; the durable ones come from
 * `GET /api/agent/plan/:taskId/activity`. When the durable projection arrives
 * it REPLACES the live list rather than merging into it, because the two number
 * their events from different places and a merge is where §11's duplicate would
 * be born. Replacement cannot duplicate: there is one list, and it comes from
 * one source at a time.
 *
 * §57 — the rendered list is BOUNDED. A long plan can emit hundreds of events,
 * and rendering all of them costs more than anyone reads. The bound is on what
 * is DRAWN, never on what is kept: the durable history is untouched, the count
 * of what is hidden is shown, and one click reveals it.
