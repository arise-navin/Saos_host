 * all terminate with one or the other on every path, including their failure
 * paths. Nothing enforced it here, so a stream that simply STOPPED — the server
 * process dying mid-turn, which is what the `--watch` restart defect did — was
 * indistinguishable from one that finished. The caller's `await` resolved, its
 * `finally` cleared the spinner, and the user was left looking at a transcript
 * that had quietly stopped halfway with no error anywhere.

 *
 * JOB 1.2b — and a WATCHDOG, because a stream can also die without ending.
 * Measured 2026-09-25: the server restarted mid-turn and vite's proxy kept the
 * browser's response open, so this reader waited forever and the chat spun
 * with no error. While a stream is open, /api/system/health is asked every few
 * seconds: a different bootId means the server restarted, repeated failures
 * mean it is gone, and a stream with no bytes (not even the 15-second ping)
 * for too long is a dead connection. Any of the three ends the request with a
