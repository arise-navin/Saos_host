/**
 * Start BOTH halves of NowHelpAssist with one command.
 *
 * This exists because of a real support trace, not tidiness. The client was
 * started on its own and the server never was, so vite's proxy answered every
 * call with
 *
 *   [vite] http proxy error: /api/incidents/stats
 *   AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
 *
 * — which names neither NowHelpAssist nor the missing process, and reads like
 * the app is broken rather than half-started. The README's two-terminal recipe
 * is still correct and still works; this removes the failure mode where the
 * second terminal is simply forgotten.
 *
 * No dependency (no concurrently/npm-run-all): this app's whole storage layer
 * is dependency-free on purpose, and a dev launcher is not the place to break
 * that. ~60 lines of child_process does the job.

 * The API watchdog, and why exit codes are not enough.
 *
 * `npm run dev` in server/ is a watcher (scripts/watch.mjs), and a watcher
 * SUPERVISOR does not exit when its child dies — it waits for the next source
 * change. So the `exit` handler above never fires for the one failure that
 * matters most: the API going away while the client stays up and happily
 * proxies into nothing. (Under `npm start` there is no supervisor: the API's
 * exit ends both halves, and says so.)
 *
 * That is precisely the state behind the report this script came from. The only
 * thing that said so was vite, in its own words:
 *
 *   [vite] http proxy error: /api/incidents/stats
 *   AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
 *
 * which names a URL and a syscall and nothing else. Polling the health endpoint
 * costs one local request every three seconds and lets the launcher say the
 * true thing instead.
 *
 * It only ever REPORTS. Killing the client on a blip would turn a two-second
 * watcher restart into a full stop, and the browser already degrades correctly:
 * useHealth() flips and the disconnected banner appears on its own.
